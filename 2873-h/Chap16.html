<p align="JUSTIFY">EARLY part of the sixteenth century was surely
a stirring time in the world's history. The night of the Dark
Ages was passing off of the Old World; the darker gloom of
prehistoric times was lifting from off the New. Spanish
discoveries followed each other in rapid succession in the South.
As yet, they supposed these discoveries to be along the eastern
shores of Asia, but, in 1513, Balboa, from a mountain peak, in
Darien, saw the gleam of the great Pacific, which intervenes
between America and Asia. At the same time he was informed there
was a country to the southward where gold was in common use, and
of as little value among the people as iron among the Spaniards.
As gold was what the Spaniards most desired, we can imagine how
they rejoiced over such information.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The rich country of which Balboa was thus
informed was later known as Peru. Balboa himself did not attempt
its discovery. There was no lack, however, of those who wished to
achieve fame and fortune by so doing. Among other restless
spirits who had been attracted to the New World, was Francisco
Pizarro. He had been associated with Balboa in founding the
settlement of Darien, and, of course, he was among the first to
hear of the marvelous country farther south. In 1518, Panama, on
the Pacific coast, was made the seat of government for the
Spaniards in that section of the country. Pizarro was one of the
first there&mdash;his services had been rewarded by the grant of
an estate. The historian of his expedition speaks of him as "one
of the principal men of the land, possessing his house, his farm,
and his Indians."<a href="#Refer"><sup>1</sup></a> We need not
doubt but what he often pondered over his knowledge of the rich
country south. He was well acquainted with Indian character, and
knew that a small band of resolute Europeans, possessed of
fire-arms, could sweep every thing before them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He could not endure the quiet life on his
estate, and so he obtained from the governor permission to
explore the coast of the South Sea to the eastward. He spent a
large part of his fortune on a good ship and the necessary
supplies for the voyage, and finally set sail from Panama in
November of 1524. It needed a man of no common spirits to
withstand the disappointments of the next few years. In less than
a year this ship returned to Panama for reinforcements. Pizarro
himself and a few of his men remained at a place not very far
from Panama. Here he was joined by reinforcements under Almagro.
Undismayed by his first experience, he again sailed southward
along the coast. Xeres's brief account is as follows: "When they
thought they saw signs of habitations, they went on shore in
their canoes they had with them, rowed by sixty men, and so they
sought for provisions. They continued to sail in this way for
three years, suffering great hardships from hunger and cold. The
greater part of the crew died of hunger, insomuch that there were
not fifty surviving. During all these years they discovered no
good land; all was swamp and inundated land without
inhabitants."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This expedition accomplished nothing further
than to obtain definite information as to Peru. Pizarro's grant
from the governor having expired, and the further fact that he
had spent all his fortune in these unsuccessful expeditions, made
it necessary for him to go to Spain. Received by the emperor with
favor, clothed with ample authority, he was able to raise men and
money, and finally sailed from Panama in 1531 on his third and
successful expedition for the conquest of Peru. Thus was made
known to the world what is regarded as the most wonderful example
of native civilization in the two Americas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The dawn of history for Peru was the sunset of
her native culture. In a few short years what has come down to us
as the Empire of the Incas was completely overthrown; the
enslaved Indians were groaning under the weight of Spanish
oppression; the demolition of her ancient monuments had already
begun, and romance, tradition, and wonder had already thrown
their subtle charms around the ruins. The old customs and usages
were on the sudden dropped, a new culture was forced upon the
unwilling natives, and prehistoric Peru, though distant but a few
years in time, was as completely separated from historic Peru as
is the culture of the Neolithic Age in Europe from that of the
early historic period.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The magician's wand in the fairy stories of
olden days did not present results more bewildering in their
changes than did the operations of the Spaniards in Peru. All
accounts unite in praising the government of ancient Peru. There
is probably no question but what the government the Spaniards
overthrew was one far better adapted to the wants of the native
inhabitants than the one they forced them to accept. But when we
read the accounts of that government as set forth by the early
writers, we are at a loss to know what to believe. There is such
an evident mixture of fables, traditions, and facts, that the
cautious student hesitates, and asks what support the researches
of later scholars give to these early writers. We doubt whether
we have to this day clear ideas of the culture of ancient Peru.
This is to be regretted. There is no question but that here was
the highest development of the Indian race in America. If we
accept the accounts given us, here rose an empire which will not
suffer by comparison with the flourishing empires of early times
in Oriental lands. Let us try and learn what we can of this
culture, and see wherein it differed from that of the civilized
tribes already discussed.</p>

<center><img alt="Map of Peru" src="images/Ch16_image/PeruMap.jpg"
width="460" height="727"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must, first of all, acquaint ourselves with
the physical features of the country. We can never fairly judge
of the civilization or culture of a people until we know their
surroundings. One of the discoveries of late years is, that the
culture of a people is greatly influenced by their surroundings.
The very appearance of a country whether it is mountainous or
plain, sea-girt or inland, influences the character of a people.
Civilization is found to depend upon such common factors as
climate, food, and physical surroundings.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a> Now if we will examine the map of South
America, we will see that the entire section of country occupied
by the tribes under consideration is very mountainous. What is
known as the Andes is in reality the most eastern of the two
ranges. The western one nearer the coast is called the
Cordillera, or the Coast Range. The summit of this mountain range
often spreads out into great undulating plains, the general
elevation of which is from fourteen to eighteen thousand feet
above the sea. This series of elevated plains forms a dreary,
uninhabited stretch of country, "frigid, barren, and desolate,
where life is only represented by the hardy vicuna and the
condor."<a href="#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is the uninhabited portion of Peru. The
general width of this plateau region is about one hundred and
fifty miles. Passing this dreary stretch of country we come to
another still elevated plateau section, which extends to the
snow-clad Andes proper. The distance between these two great
mountain ranges is from one to two hundred miles, but as we see
on the map they come together in places. One such place, the Pass
of La Raya, fifteen degrees south latitude is of importance as
marking the northern extremity of the great basin of Lake
Titicaca. This basin is remarkable in many respects. It is of no
inconsiderable size, being six hundred miles in length by one
hundred and fifty in width. It has a lake and river system of its
own. At the northern extremity of the basin is the noted Lake
Titicaca, which is given by some as the traditional place of
origin of the Incas. This lake finds an outlet in the River
Desaguadero, which flows in a broad and swift stream in a
southerly direction, where it empties into Lake Aullagas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Of this lake we know next to nothing, but it
seems to be established that it has no outlet to the sea. Thus
this Titicaca basin is but another example of interior basins
like that of our own great Salt Lake. It is not, however,
favorably situated for agricultural purposes. It is a "region
where barley will not ripen except under very favorable
circumstances and where maize in its most diminutive size has its
most precarious development; where the potato, shrunk to its
smallest proportions, is bitter; where the only grain is the
quinoa, and where the only indigenous animals fit for food are
the biscacha, the llama and the vicuna."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus we see that a large part of the interior
of Peru was not desirable for habitations. But this great plateau
region north of the basin of Lake Titicaca is here and there
broken up by what we would call valleys, but which the Spaniards
more appropriately named <i>bolsons,</i> literally meaning
"pockets." These bolsons are of various altitudes, and, therefore
have different climates and productions. Some are well drained
and fertile, others are marshy and contain considerable lakes. As
a general thing, the bolsons are separated from each other by
stretches of the dreary, desolate plateau; or by ranges of
precipitous hills and mountains, or by profound gorges, along
which courses some river on its way to swell the flood of the
mighty Amazon.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The coast range of mountains of which we have
spoken runs nearly parallel to the coast, distant from it about
forty miles. This stretch of country along the entire coast of
ancient Peru is mainly a desert. Owing to causes which we need
not explain, rain is almost unknown; the consequence is, the
coast presents a dreary, verdureless, forbidding appearance. The
melting snows on the great Cordillera, however, send down, here
and there, on their western flanks, feeble rivers. Some of these
rivers reach the sea, others prolong their flow but a few miles
from the mountains before the thirsty desert swallows them from
view. As is true of all desert countries, all that is needed to
render it fertile is water; so, wherever these rivers occur there
are found wonderfully fertile valleys. Every one of these valleys
was once thickly settled, but, like the bolsons of the interior,
they were not connected with each other. Each valley is separated
from its neighbor by many miles of almost trackless desert,
across which the Incas are said to have indicated the road by
means of stakes driven into the sand and joined by Ozier ropes.
No remains of such roads have been found by modern travelers.</p>

<center><img alt="Fortress, Huatica Valley" src=
"images/Ch16_image/Fortress.jpg" width="380" height="258"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From this description it is "clear that but a
small portion of the country was inhabitable, or capable of
supporting a considerable number of people. The rich and
productive valleys and bolsons are hardly move than specks on the
map."<a href="#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a> It is necessary that we
bear this description of the country in mind. It will help us to
understand as nothing else will how the tribes located in one
rich and productive bolson could, by successive forays, reduce to
a condition of tribute tribes living in other detached valleys
and bolsons. It will also enable us to put a correct estimate on
the extravagant accounts that have reached us of the population
of this country under the rule of its ancient inhabitants. We can
also readily see why the tribes living in the hot and fertile
valleys along the coast, which were called Yuncas by the
Peruvians, should differ in religion and mental and moral
characteristics from the tribes living in the bolsons of the
interior, where the snow-clad peaks were nearly always in sight,
and where the sun, shedding his warm and vivifying beams, would
appear to the shivering natives as the beneficent deity from
whence comes all good.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now turn our attention to the tribes
inhabiting the section of country just described. We have seen
that the Mayas, of Central America, the Nahuas, of Mexico, and
the sedentary tribes, of the United States, were considerably in
advance of the great body of the Indian tribes of North America.
We find the same fact true of the natives of South America. Those
tribes inhabiting the territory of ancient Peru, and those of the
territory now known as the United States of Columbia, were
considerably further advanced than the wild tribes living in the
remaining portions of South America. Quite a number of our
scholars have grouped in one class these partially civilized
tribes of both North and South America, and called them the
Toltecan Family.<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> But others do
not think that there are sufficient grounds for such a class
division. They can not detect any radical changes in the domestic
institutions of the various tribes.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a> On this point we must wait until our
authorities are agreed among themselves.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Attempts have been made to classify the
various partially civilized tribes of Peru. There are several
difficulties in the way. It was, for instance, the custom of the
Incas, whenever they had reduced a tribe to tribute, to force
them to learn their language, which was the Quichua, and is what
the early Spanish writers call the general language of Peru.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a> How far this language was forced
on the tribes, and how far it was their own idiom, we can not
tell. Mr. Markham, who has made a very careful study of all the
authorities bearing on Peru, divides the territory of ancient
Peru into five divisions, and in each locates a number of tribes,
which he thinks forms a family.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The first, and most northern one, extends
north from near Tumbez, in the present State of Ecuador. The
second extends from Loja, on the north, to Cerro De Pasco, in
about eleven degrees south latitude. The third, and most
important, extends from this last named place to the pass of La
Raya, fifteen degrees south latitude. This was the home of the
Incas and five other closely related tribes. To the south of La
Raya is the basin of Lake Titicaca, the home of a family of
Indians generally known as the Aymara Indians. This name is,
however, wrong; these tribes should be called the Collao Indians.
These four divisions do not include any territory west of the
Cordillera range, except one part of the third division. These
four families are all closely related. Mr. Markham thinks they
all had a common origin. Mr. Squier thinks the Collao, or, as
they are generally called, the Aymara Indians, are distinct from
the others. "They differ from each other as widely as the
German's differ from the French," is his own conclusion. The
entire coast district of Peru was the home of many tribes of
Indians, about which we as yet know but little. The name by which
they are known is Yuncas.<a href="#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are now ready to proceed to a consideration
of the culture of ancient Peru, and a description of the
monuments. But before doing so we must have a word to say as to
the authorities. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru, the
Empire of the Incas was supposed to have been in existence about
four hundred years. But the Incas had no hieroglyphic or
pictorial system of recording events. The most they had was a
system of knot records or quippos, which will be explained in due
time. These records were simply aids to the memory. Mr. Squier
places them "about on a par with Robinson Crusoe's Notched
Calendar, or the chalked tally of an illiterate tapster."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a> They are manifestly of no value as
historical records.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It must be evident, then, that all our
knowledge of Peru, previous to the arrival of the Spaniards,
rests solely upon traditions. We have no reason to suppose that
these traditions are of more value in their case than in the case
of other rude and illiterate people. The memory of such people is
very short lived. The tribes in the southern part of the United
States must have been greatly impressed with Do Soto's
expedition. They heard fire-arms for the first time, and for the
first time saw horses ridden by men. Yet in the course of a few
generations they had completely forgotten all this.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One very eminent authority is Garcillasso De
La Vega.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> Let us examine his
writings a minute. He was born in Cuzco about 1540, but a few
years after the conquest. His mother claimed descent from the
royal family. He left Peru in 1560, when he was just twenty years
old, and went to Spain. He first sought advancement in the army.
Despairing of success in that line, he turned his attention to
literature. One of his first works was an account of De Soto's
expedition to Florida. The historian Bancroft thus characterizes
this work: "An extravagant romance, yet founded upon
facts&mdash;a history not without its value, but which must be
consulted with extreme caution." Yet in this work there were no
subtile ties of blood, no natural bias as there would be in favor
of the land of his birth.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">About 1600 he commenced his "Royal
Commentaries of Peru." This is the main source of information as
to ancient Peru. We must reflect that he had been away from his
native land forty years when he commenced the work. His sources
of information were the stories told him in his boyhood days, the
writings of the Spanish travelers, monks, and conquerors, and
what he learned by corresponding with his old friends in Peru,
which he did when he formed the design of writing his history. In
other words, his history rests on the traditions extant at the
time of the conquest, viewed, however, from a distance of sixty
years. Who can doubt but what the old man, writing his accounts
of this mother's race, that race that had been so deeply wronged,
wrote it under the influence of that potent spell, which the
memory of old age throws around childhood's days?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is evident we have in these accounts but
little deserving the name of history. When he undertakes to tell
us of the doings of the Incas, who are supposed to have reigned
three or four hundred years before the Spanish conquest,
descending to such details as what nations they subdued, the size
of their armies, their speeches to their soldiers, the words of
counsel they addressed to their heirs, their wise laws and
maxims&mdash;and we know that this account rests on
traditions&mdash;he who believes that they are of historical
value, is surely possessed of a good store of credulity. We do
not mean to say that his writings are of no account. On the other
hand, they are of value. The historical part we are to consider
simply as traditions, and we are to weigh them just as we would
any other collection of traditions and compare them with
monuments still extant. He is good authority on the customs and
manners of the Peruvians just previous to the arrival of the
Europeans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen what strange mistakes the Spanish
writers made in describing the government and customs of the
Mexicans. We have no doubt but what substantially the same
mistake has been made in regard to Peru. We believe that a
careful, critical study of all that has been written on the
subject of Peru by the early writers will establish this fact. As
yet this has not been done. We must therefore be careful in our
description of the state of society amongst them, as we do not
wish to make statements not supported by good authority.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must try and decide as to what is the most
probable origin of the ancient Peruvian civilization. Some of the
earlier writers on this subject would trace it to an influx of
Toltecs, the same mythical race that is credited with being the
originators of the culture found in Mexico and Central America.
But our modern scholars have clearly shown that the Toltec
Empire, which was supposed to have preceded the Mexican, never
existed. What we are to understand by the Toltecs is the
sedentary tribes of Indians, either of the Nahua or Maya stock.
The only value we would assign to the story of their dispersion
is that it is a traditional statement that the migration of the
sedentary Indians has been in a direction from north to
south.</p>

<center><img alt="Ruins at Pachacamac" src="images/Ch16_image/Ruins.jpg"
width="370" height="274"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have no means of knowing when the first
tribes arrived in the country, or of their state of culture. It
was doubtless at a very early date, and the tribes were probably
not far advanced. We have no reason to suppose the culture of
Peru was influenced from outside sources at all. We can not
detect any evidence of a succession of races in Peru. The
distinguished author to whom we have already referred<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> speaks of what he calls the ancient
Peruvians as distinguished from the modern tribes that
acknowledged the government of the Incas.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a> We think that all the evidence points
to a long continued residence of the same race of people.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We may suppose that in the fertile valleys of
the coast, and in the bolsons of the interior, tribes of rude
people were slowly moving along the line of progress that
conducts at last to civilization. There is no reason to suppose
that this progress was a rapid one. Under all circumstances this
development is slow. We must not forget the natural features of
the country. The inhabited tracts were isolated, hence would
arise numerous petty tribes, having no common aims or mutual
interests. Each would pursue their own way, and would keep about
equal pace through the stages of Barbarism.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In process of time geographical and climatic
causes would produce those effects, from which there is no
escape, and some tribes would distinguish themselves as being
possessed of superior energy, and the same results would follow
there as elsewhere; that is, the dominion of the strong over the
weak. All other circumstances being equal, we would look for this
result in a section where a mild climate and fertile soil enabled
man to put forth his energies, and rewarded his labors. All
accounts agree in speaking of the bolson of Cuzco as well
provided by nature in this respect. One eminent traveler speaks
of it as "a region blessed with almost every variety of climate.
On its bracing uplands were flocks of llamas and abundance of
edible roots, while its sunny valleys yielded large crops of
corn, pepper, and fruits."<a href="#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a> Mr.
Squier thinks that, on the whole, the climate is very nearly the
same as that of the south of France.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This bolson was the home of the Incas. A
number of writers speak of the Incas very much as if they were a
royal family. It is not necessary to discuss this point very
extensively at present. All our accounts of their early history
are traditional. Mr. Markham and Mr. Squier, both competent
judges, assert that the weight of traditions is to the effect
that the Incas originated near Cuzco. "Universal traditions,"
says Mr. Markham, "points to a place called Peccari Tampu as the
cradle or point of origin of the Incas." As near as we can make
out from the description, this was where, as seen from Cuzco, the
sun appeared to rise.<a href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must remark that the sun was the ancestral
deity of the Incas. All the Andean people worshiped some object
as an ancestral deity. "An Indian," says La Vega, "is not looked
upon as honorable unless he is descended from a fountain, river,
or lake, or even the sea, or from a wild animal, such as a bear,
lion, tiger, eagle, or the bird they called a condor, or from a
mountain, cave, or forest." The Incas claimed descent from the
sun. So we can see why their legends would center on the place
where the sun appeared to rise. In after years, when they had
extended their conquests to the Collao,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a> and stood on the shore of Lake
Titicaca, the sun appeared to them to rise out of its waves; and
so this lake became to them a second point of traditional
origin.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We see we can not solve the question of the
origin of the Incas until we solve the deeper problems of the
origin of the Andean tribes. Every thing seems to indicate a
long-continued residence, perhaps for centuries, and a slow
advance in culture. We are not to suppose the Incas were endowed
with unusual capacity for improvement; all the tribes were
probably about equal in this respect.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a> But their situation was in their
favor, and they did not have to contend with those obstacles that
confronted other tribes. They must have increased in numbers and
in culture; they would in time feel themselves strong enough for
conquest. We must bear in mind the peculiar geographical features
of the country. In the isolated valleys and bolsons were living
other tribes, but little inferior to the Incas. There were no
common interests between these tribes. One by one they fell
before the assaults of the Incas, and were reduced to tribute.
Rendered still more powerful by success, the Incas pushed on
their conquests until finally all the tribes living in that vast
stretch of country from the Andes to the Pacific, from Chili to
the United States of Colombia, acknowledged themselves tributary
to the Incas. This was the state of things when the Spaniards,
under Pizarro, appeared on the scene.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When we undertake to learn the history or the
state of culture among the Incas, we are entering on a difficult
subject. Of their history, we know but very little more than is
given in this outline; and owing to the complete absence of all
records, we can not expect to know very much. Garcillasso draws
such an inviting picture of the happy government of the Incas,
that we would suppose that no rebellion or insurrection would
ever occur. It seems, however, that their government was as much
subject to such trials as any. Mr. Forbes tells us that "the
Aymaras never submitted tamely to their Peruvian masters, but
from time to time gave them much trouble by attempting to recover
their independence." And M. Reville tells us of the Incas that,
"more than once they had to suppress terrible insurrections." And
we shall see, further on, that the probabilities are that the
various tribes composing this so-called empire were not more
compact and united than were the tribes composing the Mexican
Empire.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Shortly before the conquest, the Incas had
reached their zenith of power. Huayna Capac, who died about 1525,
was in reality the last of the Inca chiefs. Under his management
the tribes as far north as Quito were reduced to tribute. The
story goes that shortly before his death he divided the empire
between two of his sons. One, Huascar, the rightful heir to the
throne; the other, Atahualpa, half-brother to Huascar. His mother
was daughter of the last king (?) of Quito. Her father had been
forced to submit to the victorious Huayna Capac. This division of
the Incarial Empire, was not at all to the liking of either
Huascar or Atahualpa. They both wished to be sole Inca. Civil war
was the result. Atahualpa, by treachery, had taken his brother
prisoner, and would doubtless have achieved his ambition, but
just then Pizarro invaded the country, and the reign of the Incas
was over.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus far, the story. We very much doubt
whether this expresses the facts of the case. There is no
question, of course, that civil war was in progress when the
Spaniards arrived, which war, by the way, was a very fortunate
thing for the Spaniards; but we do not know enough about the
government of the Incas to know whether Huayna Capac could
bequeath any powers to his sons. About all we are justified in
saying is, that on his death, two persons (they were very likely
brothers, and sons of Huayna Capac) aspired to the chieftaincy of
the Incas, and, failing to agree, resorted to war to settle the
matter.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The question is, how far back in the
unrecorded past can we follow tradition? Huayna Capac is thought
to have been chief for about fifty years. His predecessor is said
to have been one Tupac Yupanqui. Velasco, an early writer on the
Peruvians, thinks he was chief for about thirty-six years. As
this would carry us back nearly one hundred years, it must be
evident we have gone about as far as we can place any reliance on
tradition. However, the third chief, going backwards, was also
called Yupanqui, sometimes denominated "Yupanqui the Great," and
his reign (?) takes us back to about the year 1400. "Beyond this
point," says M. Castaing, "we fall into a mythological era." We
fully agree with him. We can not think there is any special value
in accounts of events said to happen before that time&mdash;that
is, for historical purposes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">That there were victorious chiefs, conducting
victorious forays before that date, is, of course, admitted. That
the names of many of the chiefs have come down to us, as well as
some of their notable achievements is quite possible. It is also
evident that some mythological personages would appear in
tradition as "reigning Incas." It is equally plain that neither
Garcillasso, nor any of the Spanish writers, had any clear ideas
of these ancient times or events. All traditions finally settle
on Manco Capac as the first chief of the Incas. M. Castaing says
he "is but an allegory of the period of formation."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> The date of the accession of this
mythological chief is given by most authorities as about the year
1000. M. Castaing thinks it was in the middle of the twelfth
century. It does not make much difference which date the reader
concludes to accept&mdash;one will do as well as the other.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us turn our attention to the culture of
the Incas, and their state of government. Here we would expect to
be on firm ground. We would expect the Spanish writers to give us
reliable accounts of the state of society of the people they
conquered. But, as Mr. Squier remarks, the overthrow of the
Peruvian government "was so sudden and complete that the
chroniclers had hardly time to set down the events which took
place before their own eyes, and had little leisure, or perhaps
inclination, to make a careful investigation into the principles
of their civil and religious polity. As a consequence, this work
has devolved upon the laborious student and arch&aelig;ologist of
a later time." In other words, we are to compare the accounts
given us by the early writers with our present knowledge of
Indian society.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have already made the statement that the
Inca were a tribe of Indians. But, if they were a tribe, did they
have the usual subdivisions of a tribe&mdash;which, we remember,
are the phratry and gens? The Spanish writers say nothing about
such divisions. This is not strange. They said nothing about the
phratries and gentes of the Mexicans; and yet they were in
existence. Neither did the English mention the institution of the
phratries and gentes among the Iroquois; and yet they were fully
developed. We answer, that the Inca tribe were divided into both
phratries and gentes. It is necessary to show what grounds we
have for such belief. It is well to have a little better
understanding of the surroundings of this tribe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The isolated section of country which they
occupied is about seventy miles long by sixty in width. "The
proper name for the aboriginal people of this tract," says Mr.
Markham, "is Incas." This word must have been at first the title
for chief&mdash;for all the chiefs in this section were called
Incas; but, in process of time, the name was assumed as the
special title of the tribe at Cuzco. Mr. Markham gives us further
the names of seventeen lineages who occupied this valley. Whether
a lineage was a tribe or not we can not decide. We will now
confine our attention to the ruling tribe at Cuzco.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Spaniards noticed that Cuzco was divided
into two parts, called respectively Upper and Lower Cuzco.
Garcillasso tells us that this division was made as follows.
Manco-Capac with his wife and queen were children of the Sun,
sent to civilize the Indians, who, before their arrival, were a
very degraded sort of savages. From Cuzco this sun-descended
couple went their different ways&mdash;the king to the north, the
queen to the south&mdash;"speaking to all the people they met in
the wilderness, and telling them how their father, the Sun, had
sent them from heaven to be the rulers and benefactors of the
inhabitants of all that land; . . . and, in pursuance of these
commands, they had come to bring them out of the forests and
deserts to live in villages." This sounded so good to the wild
tribes, that they "assembled in great numbers, both men and
women," and set out to follow their exhorters.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The tribe that followed the king settled Upper
Cuzco; while the queen's converts settled Lower Cuzco. This
division was not made so that those living in one half should
have any special privileges over the other&mdash;for they were
all to be equal, like brothers. The division was solely in order
"that they might be a perpetual memory of the fact that the
inhabitants of one were assembled by the king, and the other by
the queen." The only difference between them was, "that the
people of Upper Cuzco should be looked upon and represented as
elder brothers, and those of Lower Cuzco as younger
brothers."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Such is the account of the settlement of Upper
and Lower Cuzco. Any one acquainted with the general principles
on which the division of Indian tribes into phratries took place,
can not help concluding that these divisions were simply two
phratries. The inhabitants of each traced their descent back to a
supernatural personage. They were equal in power to each other as
elder and younger brothers. Polo Ondegardo simply remarks that
"the lineage of the Incas was divided into two branches, the one
called Upper Cuzco, the other Lower Cuzco."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a> There ought to be no objection to
substituting for the word branches used above the scientific term
our scholars now employ; that is, phratry. Each tribe of the
Iroquois confederacy was divided into two phratries, and their
name for this division was a word which meant brotherhood.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Whatever doubt we may have on this point
vanished when we come to examine into the customs of the Incas.
We must not forget that the most prominent way a phratry shows
itself is in matters of religion, and in the play of social
games. "The phratry, among the Iroquois," says Mr. Morgan, "was
partly for social and partly for religious objects. . . . In the
ball game, for example, they play by phratries, one against the
other. Each phratry puts forward its best players, usually from
six to ten on a side, and the members of each phratry assemble
together, but on opposite sides of the field in which the game is
played. The members of each phratry watch the game with
eagerness, and cheer their respective players at every successful
turn of the game."</p>

<img alt="Relics from Guano Deposits." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Relics.jpg" width="250" height="334" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us see how it was among the Incas.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a> Like all Indian tribes, the Incas were
very fond of ceremonious feasts. Nearly every month they
celebrated one or more. We gather from Molina that on occasions
when the whole tribe participated in such religious observances,
the people of Upper Cuzco sat apart front Lower Cuzco. In the
month corresponding to August they had a celebrated feast, the
object of which was to drive out all evil from the land. We read:
"All the people of Cuzco came out, . . . richly dressed, sat down
on benches, each man according to the rank he held, those of the
Upper Cuzco being on one side, and those of Lower Cuzco on the
other." And of another feast we read: "They brought out the
embalmed (?) bodies of the dead Incas, placing those who had
belonged to Upper Cuzco on the side where that lineage was
stationed, and the same with those of Lower Cuzco." Other
examples could be given, but this point is well established. In
games this same division was observed, since we read that in the
month of December, "on the first day of the month, those who had
been armed as knights&mdash;as well those of the lineage of Upper
Cuzco as those of Lower Cuzco&mdash;came out into the square with
slings in their hands, . . . and the youths of Upper Cuzco hurled
against those of Lower Cuzco." We may therefore consider it well
established that the Incas were a tribe of Indians having two
phratries.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us now see how the matter stands in regard
to gens. This division follows almost as a matter of course, but
it is well to see what separate grounds exist for the assertion.
Garcillasso, in his description of Cuzco, after a reference to
the division into Upper and Lower Cuzco, tells us further that it
was divided into twelve wards. Mr. Squier gives us a map of the
ancient city. From this we see that the twelve wards were
arranged in an irregular oval around the principal square. Seven
of them belonged to the division of Upper Cuzco, the other five
to Lower Cuzco.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This division is utterly unintelligible to us,
unless we suppose them to be subdivisions of the phratries. It
makes no difference what name we bestow upon them, in effect they
can be nothing else than gentes. As to the number of them, it is
well to notice a coincidence in the statement of an Indian
writer, Salcamayhua.<a href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a> On a
certain very important occasion there were assembled "<i>all</i>
the councilors. The governor entered the chamber, where
<i>twelve</i> grave councilors were assembled."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a> The most reasonable explanation that
can be given for the number twelve is that each gens had one
representative in the council. The Incas are thus seen to be very
probably, at least, no exception to the general rule of Indian
tribes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From our present standpoint what can we learn
as to their government? It is, of course, well known what the
position of the early writers on this subject is. They all agree
that the government of the Incas was a monarchy of the strictest
type. We have seen what a wonderful empire they bestowed on the
Mexicans. The Peruvian Empire is painted in still brighter
colors. Modern writers have not allowed the early accounts to
suffer by repetition. Rivero uses the following language: "The
monarchs of Peru, . . . uniting the legislative and executive
power, the supreme command in war, absolute sovereignty in peace,
and a venerated high-priesthood in religious feasts, . . .
exercised the highest power ever known to man."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a> Even so cautious a writer as Mr.
Squier speaks of the Incas as ruling "the most thoroughly
organized, most wisely administered, and most extensive empire of
aboriginal America."<a href="#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is freely admitted that there is much that
is indeed wonderful in the culture of the Incas; but it has,
undoubtedly been greatly exaggerated. To deal with this question
as it should be would require an entire volume of itself, and
would require far more extensive research than the writer has
been able to make, or is, indeed, prepared to make. It will do no
harm to see what we can learn by comparing the statements of some
of the early writers with what we have now learned of Indian
society.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us first inquire as to the council. There
is no question as to the existence of a council. Garcillasso and
all the early writers refer to it in an accidental sort of way.
To show the force of this statement, we will give a few
quotations. Garcillasso, speaking of the movements of the Inca
Viracocha, says: "Having passed some years in making journeys, he
returned to Cuzco, where, with the advice of his councilors, he
resolved on war." And, in another place: "Having consulted with
his council" he assembled his army. Talking about the son of the
foregoing, he says: "In fine, this king, with the advice of his
council, made many laws, rules, ordinances," etc.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> In the foregoing we are made aware of
the existence of a council, but are not told as to its size or
powers. Each gens would of course be represented in the council.
We have spoken in one place of the number twelve. Mr. Bandelier
tells us that the council consisted of sixteen members.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a> As to its power we are also left in
the dark; but, judging from what we have learned of the council
among the Mexicans and Indian tribes of the North, who can doubt
but that it was the supreme governing body?<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The more we study this question, the more
points of resemblance we would find with the social organization
of the Mexicans. The tenure of land was of course the same, as we
learn from the report of Ondegardo&mdash;some differences may
have occurred in regard to tribute.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mexicans, we must remember, were at the
head of a confederacy, and the tribute was brought to Mexico to
be divided among the three tribes. The Incas were the only tribe,
in the case of Peru, having supreme power. Having no one to suit
but themselves, they introduced some new features. The tribute,
instead of being all brought to Cuzco, seems to have been, at
least a portion of it, stowed away in storehouses located at
places most convenient for the Incas. Cieza De Leon says: "The
Incas . . . formed many depots full of all things necessary for
their troops. In some of these depots there were lances; in
others, darts; and in others, sandals: and so, one with another,
arms and articles of clothing which these people used, besides
stores of food. Thus, when a chief was lodged in one of these
depots with his troops, there was nothing, from the most trifling
to the most important article, with which they were not
supplied."<a href="#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a> This tribute was
gathered by regular tribute-gatherers. As in the case of Mexico,
these appear in history as governors. Ondegardo says they left
"Cuzco every year, and returned in February, . . . bringing with
them the tribute of the whole empire."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a rule, the Incas did not interfere with
the customs of the tribes they had conquered. Garcillasso says:
"Excepting a few alterations that were necessary for the welfare
of the whole empire, all the other laws and customs of the
conquered province were retained without any change." In the
main, all they wished for was tribute. Yet they seem to have had
some idea of a higher policy than that. They are credited with
carrying out measures which would certainly tend to bring the
tribes into a close union. Mr. Squier remarks: "The efforts of
the Incas to assimilate the families that were brought within
their empire, by force or alliance&mdash;in respect to language,
religion, and modes of life&mdash;were powerful and
well-directed."<a href="#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> This was a step
ahead of any thing that can be said of the Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the matter of language, it is said they
made persistent efforts to have the conquered tribes learn their
own language. De Leon tells us that it was a law throughout the
kingdom that this language should be used&mdash;"fathers were
punished if they neglected to teach it to their children in their
childhood." How much we are to believe of this account is
doubtful. Mr. Markham has shown us that the languages of all the
interior tribes were related. We know how difficult it is to
compel a conquered people by law to learn a foreign language.
William the Conqueror made an unsuccessful attempt to compel the
Anglo-saxons to learn French&mdash;it ended by his followers
learning English. Are we to believe that a tribe of Peruvian
Indians were successful in spreading their language over a wide
extent of territory in the course of a few generations?</p>

<center><img alt="Burial Towers." src="images/Ch16_image/Burial.jpg"
width="350" height="234"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What is considered as the great stroke of
policy on the part of the Incas, was their system of colonies. On
this point De Leon tells us: "As soon as a province was
conquered, ten or twelve thousand men were ordered to go there
with their wives; but they were always sent to a country where
the climate resembled that from whence they came. If they were
natives of a cold province, they were sent to a cold one; and if
they came from a warm province, they went to a warm one. These
people were called mitimaes&mdash;which means Indians who have
come from one country and gone to another." On this we might
remark, that the Incas did not always show such discriminating
care where they sent the exiles, since Mr. Markham tells us that
the "descendants of colonists on the coasts of Peru (a warm
climate, notice) still retain traditions concerning the villages
in the Andes (a cold province), whence their ancestors were
transported."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will only refer to the so-called royal
roads of Peru. Humboldt observed them in Northern Peru, and
speaks in high praise of them. Many of the early writers mention
them. De Leon gives us a really wonderful account. Modern
travelers have not been so fortunate in finding their remains.
Mr. Squier does not mention them. Mr. Hutchinson searched at
every place along the coast, and could find no trace of such
works. The northern part of Peru, where Humboldt saw them, was
almost the last section to be conquered by the Incas. It is
singular that they should have been in such a hurry to build
roads in that section, when the other parts of their territory
were destitute of them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are now prepared to inquire as to what
remains of this ancient people have come down to us; and in
studying these ruins we must keep constantly in mind the social
organization of Indian tribes.<a href="#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a>
We notice on the map, at about 8&deg; south latitude, a place
marked Truxillo. It is situated nearly two miles from the sea, in
the valley of the Chimu. Its port is the town of Huanchaco, a
dilapidated village of a few hundred houses, about ten miles
further north. Truxillo was founded in 1535 by Francisco Pizarro,
and was once a place of considerable importance, but at present
it is probably most noted for the famous ruins located near it.
Several of the fertile coast valleys that we have previously
described, here unite; consequently this was a place of great
importance to the coast tribes. The ruins here are among the most
remarkable in Peru. The road from Huanchaco to Truxillo passes
directly through the field of ruins.</p>

<img alt="Palace." src="images/Ch16_image/Palace.jpg" width="234"
height="435" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Squier tells us that the ruins "consist of
a wilderness of walls, forming great inclosures, each containing
a labyrinth of ruined dwellings and other edifices." As our space
is limited, we will describe but one of these inclosed spaces.
This is a view of what is usually called a palace, but this
certainly is an absurd name. The inclosure contains some
thirty-two acres; the walls surrounding it are double, and
sufficiently heavy to resist field artillery. At the base the
walls, in some cases, are fifteen feet thick, gradually
diminishing toward the top, where they are not more than three
feet thick. They vary in height, the highest ranging from thirty
to forty feet high. In order to give a clear idea of these walls,
we introduce this cut, which gives us a section of the walls. The
materials of which they are built is adobe.</p>

<img alt="Section of Palace Wall." src="images/Ch16_image/PalWall.jpg"
width="211" height="159" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Within this inclosure we notice three open
places, or courts, a number of smaller cross-walls dividing the
remaining space into a number of small courts. Around each of
these courts, generally on three sides, are the ruins of houses.
All in the interior of the large inclosures is so far gone in
ruins that we can with difficulty make out the plan. Inclosures,
such as we have described here, are the principal features of the
Chimu ruins. Mr. Squier speaks of one three or four times the
size of this one. With our present knowledge we are justified in
concluding that Chimu was the head-quarters of a powerful tribe.
We are surely justified in assuming further that each of these
great inclosed squares, containing upwards of thirty, forty, and
even fifty acres, was the home of a gens&mdash;their fortified
place.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Of the houses, Mr. Squier says: "Around each
court the dwellings of the ancient inhabitants are grouped with
the utmost regularity. . . . Some are small, as if for watchmen
or people on guard; others are relatively spacious, reaching the
dimensions of twenty-five by fifteen feet inside the walls. These
walls are usually about three feet thick, and about twelve feet
high. The roofs were not flat, but, as shown by the gables of the
various buildings, sharply pitched, so that, although rain may
not have been frequent, it was, nevertheless, necessary to
provide for its occurrence. Each apartment was completely
separated from the next by partitions reaching to the very peak
of the general roof. There are no traces of windows, and light
and air were admitted into the apartment only by the door."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On one side, at least, the whole area of the
city was protected by a heavy wall, several miles of which were
still standing at the time of Mr. Squier's visit. At various
places along this wall, cross-walls extended inward, thus
inclosing great areas which have never been built over, and which
show all evidence of ancient cultivation. We notice, near the
upper end of this inclosure, a court, occupied by a mound. This
is known as a <i>huaca,</i> which calls for some explanation. It
seems that the general name among all the Peruvian people, for a
sacred object, is huaca. Being a very superstitious people, this
name is applied to a great variety of purposes, amongst others,
to these great artificial mounds, the majority of which are
probably burial mounds. The construction of many of these mounds
is very singular. It seems as if they were a large collection of
rooms, each one of which was filled with clay or adobe. In some
of these chambers, probably, treasures are concealed. One very
celebrated huaca, at Chimu, was found to contain an enormous
amount of gold vessels.</p>

<img alt="Ornamentation on Walls." src="images/Ch16_image/Ornament.jpg"
width="215" height="255" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not forget to notice the arts of the
Chimu people. The walls of the inner edifices were often
ornamented as is seen in the following cut, of which the upper
one is stucco-work and the lower one is in relief. Adobe bricks
are allowed to project out, forming the ornamental design. Other
ornaments of stucco-work were observed. The second figure on this
page gives us an idea of this style of ornaments. As an evidence
of how the climate of Peru preserves ruins, we would mention
that, though this last stucco-work has been exposed to the
elements for probably several centuries, yet it is still
apparently perfect.</p>

<img alt="Adobe Ornament." src="images/Ch16_image/Adobe.jpg" width="190"
height="164" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Chimu people were certainly very expert
workmen in gold and silver. De Leon asserts that, when the Incas
conquered them, they took to Cuzco many of the artisans of the
country, "because they were very expert in the working of metals,
and the fashioning of jewels and vases in gold and silver." In
the cut following we have two vases&mdash;the smaller one of
gold, the larger of silver. The material is very thin, and the
ornaments are produced by hammering from the inside.</p>

<center><img alt="Gold and Silver Vases." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Vases.jpg" width="322" height="208"></center>

<center><img alt="Bronze Knives and Tweezers." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Knives.jpg" width="370" height="348"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Besides such works as just described they had
the art of casting representations of men, animals, and reptiles
in silver&mdash;sometimes hollow, sometimes solid. They even cast
more complex objects. Mr. Squier says he has one "representing
three figures&mdash;one of a man, and two women, in a forest. It
rises from a circular base about six inches in diameter, and
weighs forty-eight and a half ounces. It is solid
throughout&mdash;or, rather, is cast in a single piece, and
rings, when struck, like a bell." The trees, he says, are well
represented, their branches spreading in every direction. The
human figures are also well proportioned, and full of action.
They also knew how to manufacture bronze. Many agricultural
implements are found, not only at Chimu, but all along the coast.
In the preceding cut we have bronze knives and
tweezers&mdash;also, a war-club of the same material.</p>

<center><img alt="Water-jars from Ancon." src=

<img alt="Water-jar." src="images/Ch16_image/Waterjar.jpg" width="226"
height="276" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">All the coast tribes of Peru excelled in the
manufacture of pottery. Mr. Squier tells us that, in this sort of
work we find "almost every combination of regular or geometrical
figures"&mdash;men, birds, animals, fishes, etc., are reproduced
in earthenware. In this cut we have one of the many forms. Notice
the serpent emblem.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The people of Chimu, whose ruins we have been
describing, belong to the coast division&mdash;differing in many
respects from the Peruvian tribes in the interior. Our
information in regard to the coast people is very limited. We
have to judge them almost entirely from the ruins of their towns,
and the remains of their handiwork. There is no reason to suppose
they were the inferiors of the Peruvians in culture. It is quite
the custom to speak of them as if they were low savages before
the Incas conquered the country; and that they owe to the latter
all their advance in culture. On the contrary, we may well doubt
whether their condition was at all improved by the Inca conquest.
The coast people are supposed to have been conquered about one
hundred years before the Spanish conquest. It was only after a
most stubborn resistance that the principal valleys were
subdued.</p>

<center><img alt="Cloth found in Grave." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Cloth.jpg" width="340" height="411"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not necessary, neither have we space, to
give a review of all the ruins along the coast. They are very
plentiful. There is not an inhabitable valley but that they
abound there. The soil where not irrigated is very dry, and tends
to preserve any thing buried therein. All the coast people buried
their dead; hence it is that we find, in nearly all the coast
valleys, such extensive cemeteries. At Ancon, for instance,
twenty miles north of Lima it is simply wonderful how extensive
the cemeteries are. Mr. Hutchinson says they extend for miles.
Very extensive explorations have been made here for scientific
purposes. We have given, earlier, some water-jars excavated at
Ancon, in last illustration we have some specimens of cloth found
in graves farther north; and in the same locality was found a
very wonderful piece of feather-work. The small feathers were so
fastened to a ground of cotton cloth that they could not be
pulled off.</p>

<center><img alt="Wall in Huatica Valley." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Wall.jpg" width="390" height="241"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Another noted place, about the same distance
south of Lima, is Pachacamac. Mr. Squier concludes, from the
cemeteries at this place, that it was a holy place, to which
pilgrims resorted from all parts of the empire so as to be laid
to rest in holy ground. When we learn of so many other similar
localities, we see that this conclusion does not follow. The most
we can say is, that these valleys have surely been settled for a
long while.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The city of Lima is situated on the south bank
of the Rimac River, about six miles from the coast. Its port is
the town of Callao. The valley is called the Huatica Valley. Very
extensive and wonderful rains occur in this valley, between Lima
and the sea. We are told these ruins are thick and close over a
space of a few square miles, and are inclosed within a triple
wall. The last cut is given as a representation of a portion of
this wall, though only a small portion here and there is still
discernible. Amongst these ruins are a large number of immense
mounds.</p>

<center><img alt="Burial Mound, or Huaca." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Mound.jpg" width="380" height="218"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some are huacas, or burial mounds; and some
are in the nature of fortresses. It is best to explain a little
more particularly about the burial mounds of the coast region of
Peru. This cut gives us an idea of their appearance. As to their
construction Mr. Squier says: "Many if not most of the pyramids,
or huacas, were originally solid&mdash;built up of successive
vertical layers of bricks, or compacted clay, around a central
mass or core."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But this is not always the case; since in many
huacas we find walls, in some rooms, and, finally, as before
remarked, some apparently consist of a large, many-storied
building, the rooms of which are all filled with clay. In the
mound just mentioned, Mr. Hutchinson found a number of
inclosures&mdash;though the work was done in a rough, shapeless
manner. Mr. Squier gives us a description of a many-roomed huaca
as follows: "Thanks to the energy of treasure-hunters who have
penetrated its sides, we find that it had numerous large painted
chambers, was built in successive diminishing stages, ascended by
zigzag stair-ways, and was stuccoed over and painted in bright
colors. The conquerors filled up these chambers, and recast the
edifice with a thick layer of adobe."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is surely a singular piece of work. The
building just described by Mr. Squier must have been much like a
pueblo. We wish we had fuller descriptions of it. Mr. Squier is
eminent authority, and scholars delight to honor him for his
researches. We take the liberty, however, to question some of his
conclusions. How does he know that this structure was ever used
for any other purpose than as a mound? It is indeed a singular
way to construct a mound, but when we learn of the existence of
mounds showing the different methods of work&mdash;some solid,
some with walls, others with rude rooms, still others with rooms
towards the top&mdash;why not say that this many-storied building
was simply one style of mound-building? He claims that the Incas
filled up these rooms, and transformed the house into a mound.
Mr. Hutchinson claims there is no proof that the Incas did this
sort of work.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As an example of fortress-mounds, also
prevalent in the valley of the Huatica, we present the next cut.
Mr. Hutchinson describes this mound as being eighty feet high,
and about four hundred and fifty feet square. "Some of the adobe
walls, a yard and a half in thickness, are still quite perfect.
That this was not likely to have been a burial-mound may be
presumed from its formation. Great large square rooms show their
outlines on the top, but all filled up with earth. Who brought
this earth here, and, with what object was the filling up
accomplished? for the work of obliterating all space in these
rooms with loose earth must have been almost as great as the
construction of the building in itself."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a> So it seems that in the
fortress-mounds also we meet with this same mysterious
feature&mdash;rooms filled with earth.</p>

<center><img alt="Fortress Mound." src="images/Ch16_image/Fortmound.jpg"
width="380" height="262"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Huatica Valley was also the location of a
famous temple&mdash;at least such are the traditions&mdash;and
ruins are pointed out as being those of the temple in question.
It is simply an immense, large inclosed square, of some
forty-nine acres. On each side of this square there is a huge
mass of ruins, and another in the center. In our next
illustration we have a portion of the wall surrounding the ruins
on the south side of the supposed temple. This is the largest of
the group of ruins. The walls are seventy feet high; the area at
the top is over five acres. Here, again, we notice the same
mysterious feature already referred to, for "on the top of this
were also discernible the outlines of large square rooms, filled
up, as all the others, even to the topmost height of seventy
feet, with earth or clay."</p>

<center><img alt="Temple Wall." src="images/Ch16_image/TempWall.jpg"
width="376" height="260"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut is given as a fort, meaning thereby a
fortress-mound, such as we have already described. It is said to
be situated to one side of the temple. From this we understand
that the wall seen in the cut is that already mentioned as
inclosing the temple. Another ruined fortress found in this
valley is given <a href=
"images/Ch16_image/Fortress.jpg">earlier.</a></p>

<center><img alt="Fortress, Huatica Valley." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Huatica.jpg" width="362" height="241"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Twenty miles south of Lima, in the valley of
the river Lurin, is an important field of ruins, known as
Pachacamac, which is still the name of a small village in the
neighborhood. We give a general view of the ruins. The principal
point of interest, about it is the ruins of an old temple.
Traditionally, this, is one of the most interesting points in
Peru. All the coast tribes were very superstitious. We have
already referred to the celebrated temple near Lima. The temple
at Pachacamac was of still greater renown. Arriaga, a famous
ecclesiastic, took an active part in extirpating their idolatrous
belief. From his accounts, it seems they were much addicted to
fortune-telling. Their gods were made to give out oracles and
their temples became renowned just in proportion as their priests
were shrewd in this matter.</p>

<center><img alt="Pachacamac." src="images/Ch16_image/Pacha.jpg" width=
"621" height="405"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Those at Pachacamac were especially skillful,
and it is said, pilgrims resorted to it from all parts of the
coast. As a consequence, it became very rich. The god that was
worshiped here was a fish-god. The name of this god, and the name
of this old town are alike lost to us. When the Incas conquered
the coast people, they imposed the name of one of their own
divinities on this temple, and by that name the place is now
known to us.<a href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The ruins of the supposed temple are seen on
the hill in the background of the picture. A number of writers
speak of this hill in such terms as to imply that it was
altogether artificial, like the famous pyramid at Cholula.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Squier says that it is largely artificial,
but that the central core is a natural hill. He speaks of rocks
cropping out on the highest part, which seem to be conclusive of
the matter. They built up great terraces around this central
core. These terrace walls are now in such a ruined condition that
they can with difficulty be made out. We introduce this cut as a
nearer view of the ruins of the temple.</p>

<center><img alt="View of the Temple." src=
"images/Ch16_image/TempView.jpg" width="380" height="277"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some writers assert that the Incas erected on
the summit of this hill a temple of the sun. There are, however,
no good proofs of this assertion. According to Mr. Squier the
only ruin of the Inca type of architecture is a mile and a half
distant. Mr. Hutchinson noticed, on the very top of the hill,
evidence of the same mysterious proceedings to which we have
already referred&mdash;that is, great rooms all filled up with
clay. He propounds this query: "Whose hands carried up the
enormous quantities of earth that fill every space and allow no
definition of rooms, halls, or, indeed, of any thing but the clay
itself, and the walls cropping up from amongst them?" We are
afraid this query can never be answered. Mr. Hutchinson found
graves to be very plentiful all over the field of ruins. Quite a
number of curiosities have been found in these graves. We present
in this cut some of the same. We call especial attention to the
duck-headed bowl. Compare, this with the cut given in <a href=
"Ch10_image/ClayVessels.jpg">Chapter X,</a> and we will be struck
with the similarity. Another view of the ruins at Pachacamac is
given earlier in this <a href="images/Ch16_image/Ruins.jpg">chapter.</a>
As in the case of the ruins of Grand Chimu, the whole field of
ruins was encompassed by a wall, portions of which Mr. Hutchinson
observed on the north, stretching away from the sea inland.
Explorers have found here true arches. They are said to exist in
Northern Peru. We are at a loss to account for their appearance,
for certainly the people generally were ignorant of their
use.</p>

<center><img alt="Relics from Graves at Pachacamac." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Graves.jpg" width="384" height="172"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The valley of the Canete, the next one we meet
going south, is a very large and very fertile valley. It is also
full of ruins, but not differing enough from the others to
justify a separate description. About one hundred miles below
Lima we notice three small islands. These are the Chincha
Islands, noticeable on account of the immense quantities of guano
they contain. It seems that at various depths in this guano
deposits are found relics of man. In our next cut we present some
of these objects. The two small vessels which were probably water
jars, were found buried in the guano at a depth of sixty-two
feet. The other figure, a wooden idol, was found at the depth of
thirty-five feet.</p>

<img alt="Relics found buried in Guano Deposits." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Guano.jpg" width="274" height="334" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have no very good data on which to rely
when we attempt to estimate the number of years required to bury
the water jars to the depth where found. Thousands of years must
have passed.<a href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a> The water jars are
not rude forms. No little skill is indicated by their formation.
The wooden idol is not necessarily near as old as the jars, but
no one can doubt but that it dates from long before the Inca
conquest of the valley. Another collection of small idols, and
supposed royal emblems, also found in guano deposits, but at an
unknown depth, is shown earlier in this <a href=
"images/Ch16_image/Relics.jpg">chapter.</a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have thus far been describing the ruins
that occur in the territory occupied by the coast tribes, a
people in many ways different from the great body of Peruvian
people in the interior. According to traditions, the conquest of
the coast tribes took place about one hundred and fifty years
before the Spanish conquest. The details of this conquest are
given with great precision. We doubt whether any great reliance
can be placed upon them. We might remark that while Garcillasso
traces the progress of the conquest from the south north,
Salcamayhua reverses this order, and makes the victorious Incas
march from the north to the south. One or the other made a
mistake in traditions.</p>

<center><img alt="Prehistoric Pottery Ware." src=
"images/Ch16_image/PrePots.jpg" width="364" height="250"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Inca conquest of the coast tribes was a
very thorough one. The names and traditions of the tribes were
blotted out. The word Yunca, by which they are known, is from the
Inca language. The same is true of the names of the coast
valleys, and yet, from what we have already learned of them, we
feel sure that they were very far from the degraded savages
Garcillasso would have us believe they were. The inhabitants of
each valley formed a distinct community under its own chief. De
Leon says: "The chief of each valley had a great house, with
adobe pillars and door-ways, hung with matting, built on
extensive terraces." This might have been the official house of
the tribe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">They were an industrious people, and the
evidence is abundant that they had made considerable advance in
cultivation of the ground. They "set apart every square foot of
ground that could be reached by water for cultivation, and built
their dwellings on the hillsides overlooking their fields and
gardens. Their system of irrigation was as perfect as any that
modern science has since adopted.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> It is an altogether mistaken idea to
suppose the Incas were the authors.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are not without evidence that they were
possessed of considerable artistic skill. This preceding
collection of pottery ware is not the work of savages. Mr.
Markham further tells us that they made "silver and gold
ornaments, mantles, embroidered with gold and silver bezants,
robes of feathers, cotton cloth of fine texture, etc." We have
already referred to the tasteful decorations of the walls of
Grand Chimu. "Figures of colored birds and animals are said to
have been painted on the walls of temples and palaces." At
Pachacamac the remains of this color are still seen on a portion
of the walls. This cut represents the head of a silver cylinder
found in one of the coast valleys. The ornamentation is produced
by hammering up from below.</p>

<img alt="Silver Cylinder Head." src="images/Ch16_image/Silver.jpg"
width="234" height="248" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now leave the coast regions and
investigate some ruins in the interior. We have already spoken of
the Lake Titicaca region. Not far from the southern border of
that lake we notice a place marked Tiahuanuco. Here occur a very
interesting group of ruins. They consist of "rows of erect
stones, some of them rough, or but rudely shaped by art, others
accurately cut and fitted in walls of admirable workmanship; long
sections of foundations, with piers and portions of stairways;
blocks of stone, with mouldings, cornices, and niches cut with
geometrical precision, vast masses of sandstone, trachyte, and
basalt, but partially hewn, and great monolithic doorways,
bearing symbolical ornaments in relief, besides innumerable
smaller rectangular and symmetrically shaped stones rise on every
hand, or lie scattered in confusion over the plain."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> In fact, all explorers are loud in
their praise of the beautifully cut stones found in the
ruins.</p>

<center><img alt="Terrace Wall, Tiahuanuco." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Terrace.jpg" width="410" height="247"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen in our review how general has
been the desire to raise foundations, sometimes of great extent,
on which to place buildings. This is true of the ruins under
consideration. Here the pyramid or foundation was faced with
stone work. In this illustration we have a view of such a wall
yet remaining in place. The labor expended on such a wall was
very great. We notice in the cut three large standing stones.
These are ranged along at regular intervals between. No mortar
was used in the construction of the wall. If we examine the large
standing stone carefully we will notice on the side a sort of
projecting shoulder. The stones of the wall that come in contact
with this standing stone are cut to fit this shoulder.</p>

<img alt="Method of Joining Stone, Tiahuanuco." src=
"images/Ch16_image/JoinStone.jpg" width="250" height="203" align=
"RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The remaining stones in the wall were held in
place by a peculiar arrangement, illustrated in this cut. Round
holes were drilled in the bottom and top of each stone. There is
reason to suppose that bronze pins fitted into these holes.
Furthermore, each stone was cut with alternate grooves and
projections, so as to fit immovably into each other.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One case was observed where either the will
has entirely disappeared, or else it was left unfinished, and so
we have a row of these standing stones, as seen in this
illustration. This has been called the American Stonehenge name
is inappropriate, because we have no reason to suppose the plans
of the builders of the two structures were at all similar.</p>

<center><img alt="Pillars of Stone, Tiahuanuco." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Pillars.jpg" width="422" height="151"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The most celebrated feature of these ruins is
the presence of huge gateways, each one cut out of a solid mass
of stone. We give a view of the most noteworthy of these
gateways. It is now broken, tradition says, by a stroke of
lightning.<a href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> The upper portion is
covered with carvings.</p>

<img alt="Gateway, at Tiahuanuco." src="images/Ch16_image/Gateway.jpg"
width="272" height="217" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">North of Tiahuanuco is Lake Titicaca. This was
the sacred lake of the Incas. We have already referred to the
probable origin of this feeling. Near the southern end of this
lake, on the western side, is the peninsula of Copacabana.
Separated by a narrow strait from the northern extremity of this
peninsula is the sacred island, Titicaca. According to
traditions, the Incas sought, in all ways, to beautify this
island. They built temples, and laid out gardens. The hills were
leveled as much as possible, terraced, and then covered with
earth brought from afar. According to the statements of early
writers, pilgrims were not permitted to land on its sacred soil
until they had undergone certain preliminary fasts and
purifications on the main-land. Landing on the island, they
traversed a terrace, and by a narrow passage way they were
conducted between two large buildings, where other ceremonies
were performed.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The most sacred spot in all the island was a
rock in the northern part. Only priests of especial sanctity were
allowed near it. The rock to-day presents but the appearance of a
weather-worn mass of red sandstone. It is traditionally
represented as having been plated all over with gold and silver,
and covered, except on solemn occasions with a mantle of rich
color and material. Here the sun was believed to have first risen
to dispel the primal darkness. To this day the Indians regard it
with superstitious veneration. The traveler's guide, when he
comes in sight of it, removes his hat, and reverently bows to it,
and mutters to himself a few words of mystic import.<a href=

<center><img alt="Ruins on the Island of Titicaca." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Titicaca.jpg" width="390" height="229"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The whole appearance of the island shows how
highly it was regarded. In one place the remains of a drinking
fountain were noticed. Streams from some unknown source were
still bringing to it their limpid burden. Perhaps as noticeable a
ruin as any is represented in this cut. It is called the Palace.
It is in a sheltered nook. The lake washes the very foot of the
foundation on which it stands. It is two-storied. In the lower
story were twelve rooms, so connected with each other that but
four of them communicated by doors with the outside. The others
were certainly dark and illy ventilated. The second story was
entered by means of the terrace in the rear. The same statement
may be made in regard to its rooms; they did not, however, at all
correspond in arrangement with the rooms below. The Island of
Coati, but a short distance to the south-east, was sacred to the
moon. It has also a number of ruins. The approach to this was
guarded by a number of terraces.</p>

<center><img alt="Ruins, Island of Coati." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Coati.jpg" width="400" height="190"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will describe one more class of ruins found
abundantly in the Collao region. These are burial towers, or
chulpas. A view of one is here presented. The chulpas are common
in the Titicaca basin, and usually occur in groups, and almost
always in positions from which a large extent of country can be
viewed. The great mass of a chulpa is solid, but within is a
dome-shaped chamber, into which the opening seen in the cut
leads. Sometimes the chulpas are round, and in some the masonry
is of that variety we have already mentioned, called the
Cyclopean. Another view of burial towers is given earlier in this
chapter.</p>

<img alt="Burial Tower." src="images/Ch16_image/BuryTower.jpg" width=
"200" height="167" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a mere description of ruins becomes
tiresome, we will now pass to Cuzco, and see of what we can learn
of the architecture of the Incas. The Incas were, of course, a
very rich and a very powerful tribe. All the tribes of ancient
Peru had to pay them tribute. We way therefore suppose that the
pueblo of Cuzco was well built, the houses large, and imposing,
and that the official buildings for worship and tribal business
would be commensurate with their importance as a tribe. Yet we
have but very few accounts of these buildings. Immediately after
the conquest, many of the Spanish leaders settled in Cuzco. They
made many changes in the various edifices, and introduced into
them many improvements. At present in the modern city we still
find portions of ancient walls, and can trace the foundation of
various buildings.</p>

<img alt="Terrace Wall at Cuzco." src="images/Ch16_image/Cuzco.jpg"
width="258" height="233" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The site of the city of Cuzco is very uneven.
It stands on the slopes of three hills, where as many rivulets
come together. The ancient builders had to resort to extensive
terracing in order to secure level surfaces on which to build.
These terraces, built in a substantial manner, and faced with
stone, are still standing in many places. In this illustration we
have a view of such a wall. Observe that the stones are not laid
in regular courses, nor is there any regularity as to their size.
This is a good example of a Cyclopean wall. Some of the stones
must weigh several tons, and they are fitted together with
marvelous precision, one stone having as many as twelve
angles.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">All accounts agree that the temple of the sun
was the grandest structure in Cuzco. We present an illustration
of one end of it. This end is slightly curving. It is necessary
to remark that this end now forms part of the Church of Santo
Domingo. The fine-looking window and balcony are modern additions
to this ancient building. According to Mr. Squier, the temple was
an oblong building, nearly three hundred feet long, by about
fifty in width. It formed one side of a spacious court. It did
not extend east and west, but rather north-east and south-west.
Early chroniclers affirm that the inner walls of this temple were
covered with gold. Portions of very thin plates of gold exist in
private museums in Cuzco, said to have formed part of this
covering. The end of the temple shown in our illustration was
covered with a great plate of gold intended to represent the sun.
This plate was all in one piece, and spread from wall to
wall.</p>

<center><img alt="Temple of the Sun." src=
"images/Ch16_image/TempSun.jpg" width="410" height="356"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Only fragments of the ancient buildings of
Cuzco now exist. But enough are at hand to enable us to describe
their general characteristics. As a rule, they were built around
a court, the outer surface presenting the appearance of an
unbroken wall. These walls are excellent specimens of Inca
masonry. All travelers speak in their praise. Mr. Squier says:
"The world has nothing to show in the way of stone-cutting and
fitting to surpass the skill and accuracy displayed in the Inca
structures at Cuzco." There was but one gateway to the court.
This entrance was broad and lofty. On the lintels, over the
doorway, was frequently carved the figure of a serpent. The
apartments were constructed so as to face the court, and nearly
all opened upon the same. In some cases rooms wore observed, to
which access could be obtained only after passing through several
outer rooms. Some of the walls yet remaining at Cuzco are from
thirty-five to forty feet high. This would indicate houses of two
or three stories.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is here necessary to state that the
structures we have been describing are considered by most writers
as palaces of the Inca chiefs. Names hive been bestowed upon
them&mdash;such as the palace of Huayna Capac. It is asserted
that each Inca chief built a separate palace. The credulous
traveler is even pointed to a pile of ruins said to have been the
palace of that mythical personage, Manco Capac. There is some
conflict of authority as to the names of these palaces. Modern
tradition names one of the most imposing piles as the palace of
Inca Rocca, and as such it is described by Mr. Squier and others.
Garcillasso De La Vega says this chief's palace was in an
altogether different part of the city.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a> Those who call these buildings
palaces, think the houses of the ordinary people have all
disappeared. It is evident, however, that if our views of the
state of society among the Incas be right, that it is a misnomer
to call these structures palaces. Some of them may have been
public buildings, devoted to tribal purposes. But we need not
doubt but that this was the type of communal buildings erected by
the natives of Cuzco.</p>

<center><img alt="Fortress Walls." src="images/Ch16_image/FortWalls.jpg"
width="402" height="193"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must describe one more piece of aboriginal
work. This is the celebrated Fortress of Cuzco. As we have
stated, the ancient pueblo, or city@, was built on the slopes of
three hills. One of these, easily defended, was strongly
fortified, and thus converted into a citadel. Though called a
hill, it is in reality a projecting headland. Back of it rise
still higher hills. The portion overhanging the city is very
precipitous, in fact, almost incapable of ascent. There is,
however, a pathway up this front, ascending in places by stone
steps. On this front it did not need very strong fortifications,
yet sections of stone wall, serving for this purpose, are to be
seen. They have been mostly thrown down, and the stones rolled or
tumbled down the hill to be utilized in building. The main
defensive works are where the headland commences, from which
point the city is not visible.</p>

<img alt="Section of Fortress Walls." src=
"images/Ch16_image/Section.jpg" width="240" height="189" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">In this illustration we have a view of the
three massive walls which defended the citadel. They are really
wonderful works. In order to understand the construction, we will
present an imaginary section of the walls. The walls support
terraces, but they rose above the terraces so as to form a
parapet. To prevent the accumulation of water behind the parapet,
channels were cut through the walls at regular intervals to drain
them. The height of the outer wall is at present twenty-seven
feet; the width of the terrace thirty-five feet. The second wall
is eighteen feet high; the width of its terrace is also eighteen
feet. The height of the third wall is fourteen feet.</p>

<img alt="Quippos, or Knot Record." src="images/Ch16_image/Quippos.jpg"
width="195" height="298" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Incas divided the year into twelve months,
but we do not learn how they kept track of the years. In this
respect they were behind the Mexicans. Neither do we know of any
hieroglyphics for days, or months, or years. In the matter of
keeping records, they must have been far below the Mexicans. Our
next illustration is that of one of their knot records, or
quippos. It is a very rude attempt to assist the memory. To the
base cord are attached other threads of various colors, and tied
in various ways. We, of course, know but very little about them.
It is claimed, however, that a red thread signified a soldier, or
war; a yellow one signified gold; a white one silver, or peace; a
green one wheat, or maize. A single knot is said to have stood
for ten; two knots, twenty; a knot doubly intertwined, one
hundred, etc. Also the position of the knots on the threads was
to be considered, their distance apart, the way the threads were
twisted, and many other details.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a> It is manifest, however, that this
system of records is of very little value, and is way below the
picture-writing of the Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Take it all in all, the Incas are indeed an
interesting people. We believe, however, their culture has been
greatly overrated. Our object in this chapter has been to give an
outline of the Incas and the tribes subject to them. It is
impossible in these few pages to give more than an outline.
Should the reader, by the perusal of these pages, acquire an
interest in the culture of the Andean people just before the
Spanish invasion, and be thereby induced to continue his
investigations, the writer will consider such a result reward
enough, even though the conclusions reached should be totally
opposed to those set forth in this chapter on Ancient Peru.</p>

size and shape of the rabbit. It belongs to the chinchilla
family. The llama is the only representative of the camel family
on the western hemisphere. There were three species of this genus
in Peru, the llama, alpaca, and vicuna. These domesticated and
constituted what the Spaniards in their first reports called
sheep.</li>

<li>Garcillasso impresses on his readers the idea that the Incas
was the only tribe at all civilized. The Aymara Indians were
certainly as far advanced as the Incas, and even surpassed them
in the art of cutting stone, if we conclude the ruins at
Tiahuanuco to be of Aymara origin. The tribes of the coast region
were certainly not far behind. The Muyscas, of Bogota, who were
never under the dominion of the Incas, were yet possessed of a
high degree of culture.</li>

<li>It is manifest that, during the centuries of slow development
which the Incas underwent, they had a great many chiefs. How many
we shall never know. Garcillasso gives us a list of fourteen,
including Huascar and Atahualpa. Montesino generously increases
this number to one hundred and one. Neither of them knew any
thing positive about it; but this latter number is the more
reasonable of the two. Mr. Markham, who goes at the problem in
another way, thinks there were five historical Incas, counting
Huayna-Capac the last. He surmises that the first may have
flourished two hundred years before the conquest.</li>

<li>Our authority is Christoval Molina, a priest of Cuzco. He
made a report to the bishop, which must have been written some
time between 1570 and 1584, on the "Fables and Rites of the
Incas." This was translated by Markham, and published by Hakluyt
Society in 1873. He obtained his information by gathering
together a number of aged Indians, including some priests, who
had participated in these ceremonies in the days of the
Incas.</li>

<li>We can not help wondering if the Incas did not have two chief
executives. This would make them similar to the Iroquois, and
most of the more southern tribes, such as we have already seen to
be true of the Mexicans. Mr. Bandelier says there is abundant
proof that the Incas had two chiefs&mdash;one the "dispensing
Inca," the other the "speaking head." ("Arch&aelig;ological Tour
