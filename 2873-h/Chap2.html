<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="For" src="images/Ch2_image/For.jpg" height=
"151" width="140" align="LEFT"> A CLEAR understanding of
questions relating to early man, a more or less extensive
acquaintance with Geology is required. This is by no means a
difficult task to accomplish. What so interesting as to
understand at least the outlines of the history of life on the
globe? To see how, following a definite plan, the vast continents
have grown to their present size and form; to see how animal and
vegetable life have evolved successively higher and higher forms;
to see where in this wondrous drama of creation, this strange
unfolding of life, the first faint, indecisive traces of man's
presence are to be found; to learn what great changes in climate,
in Geogony, and in life, had occurred before man's appearance,
let us pass in brief review the history of early geological
periods.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we have already stated, there must have
been a very long period of time during which no life was possible
on the globe. Of this era we know but little; for we find no
strata of rocks of an earlier date than we know life, in its
simplest forms, to have existed.<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a>
Still we are not less confident of the existence of this era, and
the mind can dimly comprehend the scene, when a nearly shoreless
ocean surged around the globe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As to the extent of time during which there
was no life, we have no means of determining. That it was almost
infinitely long is made apparent by the researches of eminent
scholars on the cooling of lava. Toward the close of this
extended period of time faint traces of life appear. Not life as
we are apt to think of it. No nodding flowers were kissed by the
sunshine of this early time. The earliest forms of flowerless
plants, such as sea-weeds, and in dry places possibly lichens
covering the rocks, were the highest forms of vegetable life.
Animal life, if present, for the fact is denied by some, occurs
in the very lowest form, merely structureless bodies, with no
especial organs of sense, or nutrition: and their motion
consisting simply in protruding and withdrawing hair-like
processes.<a href="#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a> Such was the
beginning of life. This vast period of time, which includes the
beginning, is known among geologists as Archean time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the close of this age, the history of
life properly commences. It might be well to explain the means
which the geologist uses to interpret the history of the globe.
It is now understood that the forces of nature have always
produced the same results as they do now. From the very earliest
time to the present, rocks have been forming. There, where
conditions were favorable, great beds of limestone, formed from
shells and corals, ground up by the action of the sea<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a>&mdash;in other places, massive beds of
sandstone or of sand, afterward consolidated into
sandstone&mdash;were depositing. On the land surface, in places,
great beds of vegetable <i>d&eacute;bris</i> were being converted
into coal. Now we can easily see how the remains of organic
bodies, growing at the time of the formation of these beds,
should be preserved in a fossil form. Limestone rocks are thickly
studded in places with all sorts of marine formations. Coal
fields reveal wonders of early vegetative growth. From sandstone
rocks, and shaly beds, we learn strange stories of animal life at
the time they were forming. From a careful study of these remains
together with the formation in which they occur, not only in one
locality but all over the earth, geologists have gradually
unfolded the history of life on the globe. It is admitted that,
at best, our knowledge in that direction is fragmentary. This
arises from errors in observation as well as that fossil
formations are rare, or at least localities where they are known
to exist are but few. So our knowledge of the past is as if we
were examining some record from which pages, chapters, and even
volumes, have been extracted.</p>

<center><img alt="Paleozoic Forest" src=
"images/Ch2_image/PaleoForest.jpg" height="388" width="581"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In consequence of this imperfect record we can
not, as yet, trace a gradual successive growth from the low forms
of animal and plant life, that characterized the closing period
of Archean time, to the highly organized types of the present.
The record suddenly ceases and when we again pick up the thread
we are surrounded by more advanced types, higher forms of life.
Though we may hope that future discoveries will do much toward
completing the records, we can not hope that they will ever
really be perfected. So, from our present stand-point, the
history of life on the globe falls naturally into three great
divisions.<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> This is no more than
we might expect, when we reflect that nature's laws are universal
in their action, and that the world, as a whole, has been
subjected to the same set of changes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The period following on after Archean time is
called, by geologists, Paleozoic time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">During the long course of time embraced in
this age, the forms of life present wide differences from those
of existing time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This period produced the great beds of coal we
use to-day. But the vegetation of the coal period would present
strange features to our eyes. The vegetation commenced with the
lowest orders of flowerless plants, such as sea-weeds; but,
before it was brought to a close, there was a wonderful variety
and richness of plants of the flowerless or Cryptogamic division.
In some of the warmest portions of the globe, we have to-day
tree-ferns growing four or five feet high. During the closing
part of the Paleozoic time, there were growing all over the
temperate zone great tree-ferns thirty feet or so in height. Some
varieties of rushes in our marshes, a foot or two in height, had
representatives in the marshes of the coal period standing thirty
feet high, and having woody trunks.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a> Near the close of the Paleozoic time,
vegetation assumed a higher form of life. Flowering plants are
represented. Pines were growing in the coal measures.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In animal life a similar advance is noted. The
class of animals having no backbone, or invertebrate animals,
were largely represented. But, toward the close of the Paleozoic
time, we meet with representatives of the backbone family. The
waters swarmed with fishes.<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a>
Besides these, there were amphibians; <a href=
"#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a> and reptiles in the closing portions.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="The Pterodactyl" src=
"images/Ch2_image/Pterodactyl.jpg" height="380" width="400"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus we see what a great advance was made in
life during this period. The forms of life during the early
stages of this age were inferior in this, also, that they were
all water species.<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a> But, before
it closes, we have a rich and varied terrestrial vegetation, and
also air-breathing animals. The class Mammalia, to which man
belongs, had no representative on the earth during the extended
Paleozoic time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can easily see, from the foregoing, how
appropriately this period has been named that of old life forms.
In imagination we can recall a scene of this old age. The air is
sultry and full of vapors. The soil seems hot and steaming. This
is a veritable forest, but we see none of the beautiful flowers
which we associate with tropical vegetation to-day. In the
branches of the graceful tree-ferns, we will look in vain for
birds. They were yet far in the future. Neither were there any of
the higher orders of animals present. Not a single representative
of the great class of mammals enlivened the depths of the forest.
There were fishes in the waters, but not the fishes of to-day.
Some true reptiles and amphibians disported themselves in swampy
jungles, but they were unimportant. Almost the only sound to
break the stillness, was the hum of marsh-loving insects, the
whistling of the wind, and the roar of the tempests, which we may
well believe raged with the more than tropic severity of the
present.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The time at last came for the dawning of a new
era. Vast changes had been taking place in the geography of both
continents. The region to the south-west of the Green Mountains
was upturned. The Alleghany Mountains were formed, and the region
east of the Mississippi River became part of the stable land of
the continent.<a href="#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> In Europe,
nearly as great changes occurred. The conditions of life must
have been greatly modified by these geographical changes. The
life-forms bear testimony to this changed condition. Old forms
die away, and are succeeded by those approaching more nearly our
own times. The name of this period is the Mesozoic time, or the
period of middle life forms.<a href="#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a> It
is instructive to notice the steady advance in the type of life,
both animal and vegetable. The abundant flowerless vegetation of
the coal formation of the preceding epoch dwindles away. But the
flowering trees increase in number and importance until, in the
closing period of Mesozoic time, we have trees with deciduous
leaves. A great many of our forest trees had representatives in
the forests of that epoch.</p>

<center><img alt="Ichthyosauri" src="images/Ch2_image/Ichy.jpg" height=
"272" width="545"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Palms and species like the big tree of
California were growing side by side with species akin to our own
common trees. But in the animal world there were many strange
forms. This was the age of reptiles. They domineered on the land,
in the air, and in the sea. On the land there stalked huge
reptiles fifty and sixty feet long, and, when standing erect, at
least thirty feet high.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a> Some of
these huge creatures were carnivorous, living on other animals.
Others fed on the foliage of trees. In the air, huge reptilian
bats, veritable flying dragons with a spread of wings from ten to
twenty feet, disported themselves.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a> In the sea there swam great reptilian
whales, seals, and walruses.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a>
There was a marvelous abundance of reptilian life. At the present
day, there are not more than six species of reptiles in the whole
world having a length of over fifteen feet, and not more than
eighteen species exceeding ten feet in length. But from one
limited locality, representing but one era of this age in
England, there have been discovered four or five species of
carnivorous reptiles twenty to fifty feet long, ten or twelve
species of crocodiles, lizards, and swimming reptiles from ten to
sixty feet long&mdash;besides multitudes of great flying reptiles
and turtles. Doubtless similar scenes of animal life were
everywhere represented.</p>

<center><img alt="The Labyrinthodon." src=
"images/Ch2_image/Labyrinthodon.jpg" height="299" width="367"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Birds made their first appearance during the
Mesozoic time, and here we obtain a clear view of nature's
methods of work. There is no longer a doubt but that the first
birds were simply modified reptiles. The first bird had a long
jointed tail, and a bill well supplied with formidable teeth.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a> It was during this period that
the first representative of the class Mammalia, to which man
belongs, appears.<a href="#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a> It is in the
rocks of this era that we meet with remains of marsupials, the
order to which opossums belong. This is the lowest of the
Mammalian class. To the class Mammalia belong the most highly
organized animals. They have been the ruling animals since the
close of Mesozoic time. We must now watch their development with
especial care. For this brief review, as far as it has gone, has
shown a steady and gradual progress in life forms, the lower
invariably preceding the higher. We therefore feel that it will
be vain to seek for any trace of man until we find undoubted
proofs of the existence of all the forms of animals below him.
The last great division of time is called Cenozoic.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a> This means new life forms. In this
age, the forms of life are much nearer our own. As it was some
time during this epoch when man makes his appearance, we deem it
best to go into more detail, and give the subdivisions of this
period. It has been amply sufficient to give simply the outlines
of the other periods. In order to fix more clearly the sequence
of life, we will give an outline showing the periods we have
reviewed, and also the subdivisions of the Cenozoic time, which
we are now to examine with more care.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">At the close of the Mesozoic time, great
elevations of land took place in both America and Europe,
especially in the northern portions.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> This could not fail to have a great
effect on life, both animal and vegetable.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">During the Eocene, or first division of the
Tertiary Age, we have simply to note the steady progress of life.
There were forests of species of oaks, poplars, maples,
hickories, and other common trees, and others now found only in
tropical regions. Palm trees were growing in the upper Missouri
region of the United States. And England was decidedly a land of
Palms, as no less than thirteen species are known to have been
growing there. Cypresses, yews, and pines graced the scene.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a> Our special interest centers,
however, in the mammals of this epoch.</p>

<center><img alt="The Paleotherium." src=
"images/Ch2_image/Paleotherium.jpg" height="282" width="356"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the preceding epoch marsupials only were
represented. But in beds of the middle and closing portions of
the Eocene period we meet with a sudden increase of Mammalian
life. Whale-like animals were especially abundant in the seas;
and on our Western plains were animals like the tapirs of India,
and rhinoceros- like animals as large as elephants<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a> but having no trunks, and diminutive
little animals not larger than foxes, from which have come our
horses. Europe also had a varied Mammalian fauna. There were
numerous hog-like animals. Animals, like the tapirs of tropical
Asia and America, wandered in the forests and on the banks of the
rivers. Herds of horse-like animals, about the size of Shetland
ponies, fed on the meadows.<a href="#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a>
Animals that chew the cud were present, or at least had near
representatives.<a href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Among the flesh-eating animals were creatures
resembling foxes, wolverines, and hyenas.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a> This shows what a great advance had
been made. But, besides all these, we are here presented with
representatives of the order of Quadrumana, or four-handed
animals. Several genera of lemurs are found in both America and
Europe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now the Quadrumana are the order below man.
Therefore it seems that in the Eocene period, all the forms of
life <i>below</i> man are represented. The time seems to be at
hand when we can look, with some confidence, for traces of the
presence of man himself. We must therefore be more cautious in
our investigations.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The epoch following on after the Eocene is
designated as the Miocene. We must remember that, though recent
in a geological sense, yet it is immensely remote when measured
by the standard of years. We must inquire into all the
surroundings of this far away time. The geographical features
must have been widely different from the present.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the first place, the elevation of land to
the north must have been sufficient to have connected the land
areas of the Northern Hemisphere&mdash;North America, with Asia<a
href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a> and Greenland; and this latter
country must have been united with Iceland, and, through the
British Islands, with Europe. But, to compensate for this land
mass to the north, large portions of Central and Southern Europe
were beneath the waves.<a href="#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a> The
proof of this extended mass of land is to be found in the wide
distribution of similar animals and plants in the Miocene time.
All the chief botanists are agreed that the north Polar region
was the center from which plants peculiar to the Eocene and
Miocene epochs spread into both Europe and America.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a> We may mention that the famous big
trees of California are simply remnants of a wide-spread growth
of these trees in Miocene times. They can be found in a fossil
state at various places in British America, in Greenland, and in
Europe. They are supposed to have originated somewhere in the
north, and spread by these land connections we have mentioned
into both Europe and America. But this is not the only tree that
grew in the Miocene forests of both continents. The magnolia,
tulip-tree, and swamp cypress are other instances.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a> Eleven species, growing in the Rocky
Mountain regions in Rocene times, found their way to Europe in
the Miocene times,<a href="#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> driving
before them the plants of a tropical growth that had hitherto
flourished in England. Now this implies land connection between
the two continents. Furthermore, animals both large and small are
found common to the two countries.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a> The climate over what is now the North
Temperate Zone, and even further. north, must have been
delightful. There is ample testimony to this effect in the rich
vegetative remains over wide areas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Spitzbergen, within twelve degrees of the
pole, where now a dwarf willow and a few herbaceous plants form
the only vegetation, and the ground is most of the time covered
with snow and ice, there were growing, in Miocene times, no less
than ninety-five species of trees, including yews, hazels,
elders, beech, elms, and others.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a> But it is in the Miocene forests of
the continent of Europe where we meet with evidence of a
singularly mild climate.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There were at least eleven species of palms
growing in Switzerland; and one variety of them grew as far north
as Northern Germany.<a href="#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can not give a list of all the species. On
the one hand, there were elms, willows, poplars, oaks, and
beeches, thus far similar to the forest growth of temperate
regions. Mingled with these were forests of trees like the
tulip-tree, swamp cypress, and liquid amber or sweet gum of the
southern part of the United States&mdash;plants whose home is in
the warm and moist regions of the earth. But there were also
representatives of the tropical regions&mdash;such as fig-trees,
cinnamon-trees, and camphor-trees: these are found growing now in
tropical countries. Fruit-trees of the cherry, plum, and almond
species were also to be seen. Prof. Heer points out how all this
should convince us that a large part of Europe, in the Miocene
Age, possessed a climate not unlike that of the Madeira or Canary
Islands to-day. He calls especial attention to the fact that
these trees were nearly all of evergreen species, and that a
severe winter would destroy them. He finds one hundred and
thirty-one species of the Temperate Zone&mdash;species that can
stand a moderate amount of cold, but not very hot and dry
climates. He finds eighty-five species of tropical plants that
could not possibly live where the Winters are severe. Mingled
with these were nearly three hundred species whose natural home
is in the warm, temperate portions of the earth. The only way you
can explain this motley assemblage of trees is, to suppose that
in what is now Europe was a climate free from extremes, allowing
the trees to put forth flowers and fruits all the year round.
"Reminding us," says Prof. Heer, "of those fortunate zones where
Nature never goes to rest."<a href="#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Miocene Mammals." src="images/Ch2_image/MioMam.jpg"
height="526" width="380"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us now inquire as to the animals that
roamed through these great forests we have been describing. The
Miocene period extended over a long lapse of time, and
considerable change took place among the animals belonging to the
different parts of this age. We will only give a general outline
for the whole period. The marsupials lingered along into the
early stages of this period, and then disappeared from Europe.
The rhinoceros were present in the early stages, and continued
through the entire age. We meet in this period animals of the
elephant kind, two species, the mastodon and deinotherium.
Antelopes and gazelles wandered in vast troops over the plains of
Hungary, Spain, and Southern France. Carnivorous animals
resembling tigers and hyenas found abundance of animal food.
Herds of horse-like animals fed on the rich herbage of the
meadows. The birds were largely represented. In the woods were to
be seen flocks of gayly feathered paroquets and trogons. On the
plains secretary- birds hunted the serpents and reptiles, which
furnished them food&mdash;and eagles were on the watch for their
prey. Cranes waded in the rivers for fish. Geese, herons, and
pheasants must have been abundant.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Our main interest centers in the order
Quadrumana. We must remember that this order appeared in the
Eocene. Several species were present in the Miocene. They
wandered in the forests of France, Switzerland, Germany, and
Italy, and doubtless found abundant food in the figs and
bread-fruit, walnuts, almonds, dates, and other nuts growing
there.<a href="#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> One of the most
important is regarded as belonging to the same genus as the
Gibbons.<a href="#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a> This is the genus
which has been sometimes regarded as making a nearer approach to
man than any other monkey.<a href="#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a>
Others, however, consider it as belonging to an extinct family.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> In addition to this species there
were at least three other species: thus there was no absence of
simian life in the Miocene.<a href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the sketch we have thus far drawn of the
Miocene Age, it seems to have been a very favorable one in every
respect. One writer<a href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> affirms,
that "the world never experienced a more beautiful period." And
indeed it seems as if the facts bear out this statement. A
genial, temperate climate was the rule, even to high northern
latitudes. We need not doubt but that there were grassy plains,
wooded slopes, and rolling rivers. Was man present to take
advantage of all these favorable surroundings? Did he wander
through the evergreen forests, and hunt the deer, antelope, and
hogs&mdash;the hipparions, and mastodons, and
deinotheres&mdash;then so numerous?<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> We know of no inherent improbability
of his existence at that time. An ape belonging to a highly
organized genus was then living in Europe. Every condition
considered necessary for the primeval Garden of Eden was then
satisfied. Let us stop for a minute and examine the nature of the
evidence considered sufficient to prove the presence of man
during any of the past geological ages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Should we be so fortunate as to find portions
of the bones of the human skeleton in a geological formation in
such positions that they could not possibly have been introduced
there since the deposition of the containing bed, it would of
course prove that man was at least as old as the formation
itself. But it happens that human remains in beds of a previous
geological age are very rare. Indeed, human remains in formations
of the Pleistocene Age,<a href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> during
which we have ample testimony, as we shall see, of the presence
of man, are very rare. The cases in which there can be no doubt
can be reckoned on the fingers. The explanation of this state of
things is not at all difficult, for it is only under very rare
circumstances that portions of the bones of animals even larger
than man are preserved to us in geological strata. Vast numbers
die and vanish away without leaving a trace behind them for every
fragmentary bone we recover. In the case of man we must remember
that, in previous eras, he was present in very small numbers;
that, owing to his intelligence, he would not be as liable to be
drowned and swept away, and so mingle his remains with beds of
river detritus then forming, as were animals. Mr. Lyell has made
some remarks on the draining of the Haarlem Lake by the
government of Holland in 1853, which shows that even favorable
circumstances do not always preserve remains for future
inspection. Though called a lake, this body of water was an arm
of the sea, covering about forty-five thousand acres. The
population which had lived on the shores of the lake was between
thirty and forty thousand souls. "There had been many a
shipwreck, and many a naval fight on those waters, and hundreds
of Dutch and Spanish soldiers and sailors had met there with a
watery grave," yet not a solitary portion of the human skeleton
was to be found in its bed.<a href="#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a>
Thus we see that, in the majority of cases, we must rely on other
evidence than the presence of human bones to prove the existence
of man in the geological periods of the past. In the case of the
Haarlem Lake again, there was found the wreck of one or two
vessels, and some ancient armor. So, had it been a disputed point
whether man was a denizen of this planet at the time when the
area in question was covered by water, it would have been settled
beyond a doubt by these relics of his industry, even though
portions of the human frame itself were entirely wanting. And, in
reality, proofs of this nature are just as satisfactory as it
would be to discover human bones. If, on a desert island, we find
arrow-heads, javelins, a place where there had been a fire, split
bones, and other <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a feast, we are as much
justified in asserting that man had been there, as we would be
had we seen him with our own eyes. In the same manner, if we
detect in any strata of the past any undoubted products of human
industry&mdash;such as weapons, or implements and
ornaments&mdash;in such position that we know they could not have
been deposited there since the formation of the bed itself, we
have no hesitancy in asserting that man himself is of the same
antiquity as the strata containing the implements. In the great
majority of cases, this is the only kind of evidence possible to
advance.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is now well known that the first stage in
the culture of any people, is what is called the Stone Age. That
is to say, their weapons and implements were made from stone, or
at least the majority of them were. We will discuss on another
page this point, and also the grounds leading us to infer that
many of the extremely rude forms are really the work of man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us now return to the Miocene Age, in which
we are to seek for the presence of man. In 1867 a French
geologist, by the name of Bourgeois, who had been searching some
beds of the Miocene Age, near Thenay, France, found a number of
flints of such a peculiar shape, that he concluded they could
only be explained by supposing that man formed them. In this case
there is to question as to the age of the stratum containing the
flints. All geologists are agreed that it is of the Miocene Age.
The question then is, whether the flints were artificially cut or
not. On this question there has been a great division of opinion,
and we can not do better than to examine and see where the
Principal scientific men stand on this point.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1872, at the scientific congress in
Brussels, this question was referred to a committee composed of
the most competent men from the different countries of Europe. We
are sorry to say that, after a thorough consideration of them,
the judges were unable to agree. Some accepted them, others
rejected them, and still others were undecided. Some of the
latter have since become convinced by recent discoveries.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Since this discovery, similar specimens have
been described as having been found in Portugal, and from another
locality in France. Some men of the highest authority accept
these flints as proving the presence of man in Miocene times.
This is supported by such men as Quatrefages, Hamy, Mortillet,
and Capellini.<a href="#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a> These are all
known to be competent and careful geologists. Another class does
not think the evidence strong enough to declare these flints of
human origin, and so do not think it proved that man lived in
Europe in Miocene times; but do believe that we will eventually
find proofs of his existence during that era in the warm and
tropical regions of the globe. This is the view of such men as
Lubbock, Evans, Huxley, and Winchell. Still others say that,
during the vast lapse of years since Miocene times, all the
species of land mammals then alive have perished<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a>&mdash;their place being taken by other
species&mdash;and therefore it is incredible that man, the most
highly specialized of all animals, should have survived. And
hence, if these Thenay flints are really artificial in their
origin, it is more reasonable to suppose they were cut by one of
the higher apes, then living in France, than by man. This is the
view of Prof. Dawkins and Prof. Gaudry.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a> As to the last view, it is surely but
reasonable to suppose, with Quatrefages,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>49</sup></a> that the superior intelligence of man
would serve to protect him from the operation of causes that
would effect the extinction of lower animals. Hence, unless some
evidence be produced to show that species of apes are known to
make rude stone implements, or some evidence that they did this
in past ages, we must believe, with Geikie and others, that these
flints prove that Miocene man lived in France, unless indeed we
refuse to believe that they are artificial.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It also seems to us that those who hold to the
view that man was living in other parts of the world, as Asia,
during the Miocene Age, ought readily to admit that a few
wandering bands might penetrate into Europe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>50</sup></a> The climate was tropical, there was an
abundance of animal life, and, if man was living anywhere, it is
very reasonable to suppose that, at some epoch during the course
of the Miocene Age, he would have found his way to Europe, unless
shut off by the sea. It therefore seems to us that the presence
of those cut flints is conclusive of the presence of man in
Europe during the Miocene Age. At the same time we can not affirm
that this is the conclusion of the scientific world. They seem to
have heeded the remark of Quatrefages, that "in such a matter
there is no great urgency," and are waiting for further
discoveries.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus far in our review we have noticed the
steady progress in the forms of life. In the Miocene Age we have
seen all the types of life below man present, and some
indications of the presence of man himself. We must now learn
what we can of the Pliocene Age, the last division of the
Tertiary Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Pliocene Age need not detain us long.
Considerable changes in the geography of both Europe and America
were going forward during the Miocene Age, and the result was
quite a change in climate. There was a steady elevation of the
Pacific coast region of America, and, as a consequences a period
of great volcanic outbursts in California and Oregon.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>51</sup></a> At the same time the bridge connecting
Asia and America was severed.<a href="#Refer"><sup>52</sup></a>
In Europe the Mediterranean area was elevated; but the land
connecting Greenland with Europe sank, allowing the cold waters
of the Arctic to communicate with both the North Sea and the
Atlantic&mdash;England at that time forming part of the great
peninsula extending north and west from Europe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>53</sup></a> The climate during the Pliocene Age
was cooler than that of the Miocene. This is marked in the
vegetation of that period. The palms and the cinnamon trees,
which in Miocene times grew in Germany, flourished no farther
north than Italy during the Pliocene.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Count DeSaporta, who made special researches
in the flora of this period, found the remains of a forest growth
buried under lava on the side of a mountain in Cantal France, at
an elevation of about four thousand feet above the level of the
sea. This consisted principally of pines. This shows that
probably all Northern Europe was covered with somber forests of
pine. In the same section he found, buried under volcanic ash, a
vegetation consisting mostly of deciduous trees&mdash;maples,
alders, poplars, willows, elms, and ashes. As this was growing at
the height Of about twenty-three hundred feet in Cantal France,
it probably represents the vegetation of Britain and Northern
Germany. Finally, the vegetation of Central and Southern France,
as well as Northern Italy, was intermediate in character between
the luxuriant evergreen forests of the Miocene Age and that now
growing there. The tropical character of the vegetation was
evidently passing away. The climate over a large part of Europe
was now temperate, though probably warmer than at present.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the Mammalia we have to notice the
disappearance of some species, and the arrival and spread of some
others. The apes living as far north as Germany in the Miocene
Age were restricted to Southern France and Italy in the Pliocene,
and, at its close, vanished altogether from Europe. The first
living species of mammals is found in the remains of the
hippopotamus that frequented the rivers of Pliocene times. The
mastodon of Miocene times was still to be seen, but along with it
was a species of true elephants. The hipparion survived into this
epoch, but the horse also makes its appearance. Great quantities
of deer roamed over the land; and, as might be expected where
they were so abundant, the carnivorous animals allied to the
bears and wolves, panthers, linxes, and tigers, were also to be
found. "At night," says Mr. Dawkins, "the Pliocene forests of
Central France echoed with the weird laughter of the hyena."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The gradual lowering of the climate is also
shown by the remains of the mollusks deposited in beds of marine
or sea formation during different eras of this age. It is found
that the earlier the bed, the more southern mollusks are found in
it. This shows us that, all through the Pliocene Age, the waters
of the seas surrounding England were gradually growing cooler,
thus compelling the retreat of those mollusks fitted only for a
warm climate, and allowing a gradual increase in those species
fitted for cold or northern latitudes. We also find, in deposits
made near the close of Pliocene times, numbers of stone which
show all evidence of having been borne thither by means of ice.
So we may conclude that rafts of ice came floating down the North
Sea during the closing period of the Pliocene Age.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>56</sup></a> Still, during the entire length of the
Pliocene Age, Europe certainly offered an inviting home for man.
Not only were the higher orders of animals present, but at least
one living species was known. We find more proofs of his
presence, but whether they are sufficient to convince us that man
really lived during that epoch is to be seen.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Prof. Whitney has brought to the attention of
the scientific world what he considers ample evidence of the
presence of Pliocene man in California. We reserve this for
discussion in another place. We will only remark, at present,
that the evidence in this case is regarded as sufficient by some
of the best of American Scholars.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a> We simply mention them here, so that
they may be borne in mind when we see what evidence Europe has to
offer on this point. In 1863, M. Desnoyers, of France,
discovered, in a stratum which he considered Pliocene, some bones
of elephants and other animals cut and scratched in such a manner
that he considered the cuts to be the work of man. As showing how
cautious geologists are of accepting such conclusions, we mention
this case. There was found in the same bed the remains of an
extinct beaver. The question was at once raised, whether rodents
by gnawing these bones could not have produced the cuts in
question. Sir Charles Lyell, by actual experiments in the
Zoological Gardens in London, soon showed that this was probably
the fact.<a href="#Refer"><sup>58</sup></a> Yet Sir John Lubbock
thinks it quite likely some of them were of human origin.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>59</sup></a> Subsequently, however, M. Bourgeois
discovered in the same bed worked flints, about the human origin
of which there seems to be no doubt;<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>60</sup></a> but a more careful study of the
formation in which they occur has raised questions as to its age.
Though usually held to be Pliocene, some careful observers
consider it to be of a later age. Geologists can not be accused
of rashly accepting statements as to the antiquity of man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1867 there was discovered, in Northern
Italy, a human skull in a railway cutting at a depth of nearly
fifty feet. This stratum contains remains of several Pliocene
animals. This is held to prove the existence of Pliocene man by
several eminent observers, amongst others Prof. Cocchi, of Italy,
and Forsyth Major.<a href="#Refer"><sup>61</sup></a> But in this
case Mr. Dawkins contends that it was not found under such
conditions as render it certain that the stratum had been
undisturbed, and so does not prove to a certainty that it was of
the same age as the stratum.<a href="#Refer"><sup>62</sup></a>
And Mr. Geikie thinks that the stratum itself is of a later age
than the Pliocene.<a href="#Refer"><sup>63</sup></a> It is but
right that geologists should thus carefully scan all the evidence
produced.</p>

<center><img alt="Cut on Bones of a Whale from Pliocene Deposit."
src="images/Ch2_image/Cut_on_bones.jpg" height="219" width=
"345"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1876 Prof. Capellini discovered, in a
Pliocene deposit in Italy, the bones of a whale, which were so
marked with cuts and incisions that he thought the only
explanation was to say they had been cut by men. In this case<a
href="#Refer"><sup>64</sup></a> there is no dispute as to the age
of the stratum. Neither is there much doubt but that the cuts are
the work of man. It is quite true that Mr. Evans has suggested
that they may be the work of fishes. In this he is followed by
Prof. Winchell.<a href="#Refer"><sup>65</sup></a> But there
appears to be little ground for such belief, because the cuts are
all on the outside faces of rib-bones, and the outer faces of the
backbones. From the position occupied by the remaining portions
of the skeleton, Prof. Capellini is sure that the animal had run
aground, and, in that condition, was discovered and killed by
men, who then, by means of flint knives, cut away such portions
of food as they wished. It must have been lying on its left side,
since the cuts were all made on bones of the right.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>66</sup></a> It is not probable that fishes would
have been apt to choose the outside faces of the ribs on the
right side for their meals. These cut bones have been carefully
examined by many competent men, who have agreed with Capellini
that they are the work of men.<a href="#Refer"><sup>67</sup></a>
Mr. Dawkins thinks the cuts were artificial, but he says, "It is
not, however, to my mind satisfactorily shown that these were
obtained from undisturbed strata."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>68</sup></a> Now these bones have been found in
several localities, always in Pliocene deposits, which formed the
shores of the Pliocene sea.<a href="#Refer"><sup>69</sup></a>
Knowing how carefully geologists inquire into all the
surroundings of a find, surely, if Capellini and others are the
competent men they are admitted to be, they would have informed
us long ago if they were not found in undisturbed strata.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Dawkins also objects because fragments of
pottery were found in the strata. "Pottery," says he, "was
unknown in the Pleistocene Age,<a href="#Refer"><sup>70</sup></a>
and therefore is unlikely to have been found in the Pliocene."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>71</sup></a> Mr. Geikie says this objection is
founded on a mistake, as Prof. Capellini told him the pottery was
found lying on the surface, and was never for a moment imagined
by him as belonging to the same age as the cut bones.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>72</sup></a> There is also the objection, that,
inasmuch as all the mammals then alive except one have perished,
it is more than likely that, had man been in existence then, he
too would have disappeared.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We considered this point fully when
speculating as to the presence of man in the Miocene: so we have
nothing further to offer. We might, however, suggest that, if the
hippopotamus amongst mammals could survive all the changing time
since the Pliocene, as it has done, it seems no more than fair to
admit equal power of endurance to the human species. The position
then of the scientific world as to the Pliocene Age of man is, on
the whole, more decided in its favor than for the Miocene Age.
Quite a number of eminent scholars, whose conclusions are worthy
of all respect, unhesitatingly affirm the existence of Pliocene
man in Europe. Others are not quite ready to admit his existence
in Europe, but do think he was in existence elsewhere. Still
others, with all due respect for the discoveries of Capellini,
think it more prudent to await further discoveries. The reader,
who has followed us through this brief outline of the past, can
join which of the classes he will, and be sure of finding himself
in good company.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This completes our review of past geological
ages. With the termination of the Pliocene Age we find ourselves
on firmer ground. We only wish to call attention once more to the
gradual unfolding of life. We see that the rule has been that
everywhere the lower forms of life precede the higher. In the
plant world flowerless plants precede the flowering ones. The
coal we burn to-day is mainly the remains of the wonderful growth
of the flowerless vegetation of the Paleozoic Ace. When flowering
plants appear, it is the lower forms of them at first.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It was long ages before trees with deciduous
leaves appeared. The growth of animal life is equally
instructive. First invertebrate life, then the lowest forms of
vertebrate life. The fishes are followed by amphibians&mdash;then
reptiles, then birds. The first mammal to appear was the lowest
organized of all&mdash;the marsupials. And we have seen the
sudden increase of mammalian life in Tertiary times. We notice,
in all the divisions of life, a beginning, a culmination, and a
decline. There has never been such a growth of flowerless plants
as in the Paleozoic, and flowering plants probably culminated in
the Miocene. The same rule holds good for the animal world also.
As man is the most highly organized of all the animals, we can
not hope to find any evidence of his presence until we find
proofs of the presence of all the lower types of life. Of course
future discoveries may change our knowledge when the series is
complete; but, from our present stand-point, he could not have
lived before the Miocene Age, and we have seen how faint and
indecisive are the proofs of his presence even then. But should
it finally be proved, beyond all dispute, that man did live in
the Miocene Age, we must observe that this is but a small
portion, but a minute fraction, of the great lapse of time since
life appeared on the globe. We are a creation of but yesterday,
even granting all that the most enthusiastic believer in the
antiquity of man can claim.</p>

the Eocene. What countless ages back must we go for the origin of
these groups&mdash;the whales from some ancestral carnivorous
animal, the bats from the insectivora!" and even then we have to
seek for the common origin of these groups at far earlier
