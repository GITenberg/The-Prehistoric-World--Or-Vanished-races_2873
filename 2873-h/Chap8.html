<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="The" src="images/Ch8_image/The.jpg" height=
"182" width="114" align="LEFT">INTRODUCTION of bronze was the
harbinger of better days to the various tribes of Europe. Without
metals it is doubtful if man would ever have been able to raise
himself from barbarism. His advance in civilization has been in
direct proportion to his ability to work metals. As long as he
knew how to work bronze only he could not hope for the best
results. The trouble was not in the metal itself, but in the
supply; for copper and tin, the constituents of bronze, are found
only in limited amounts. When we reflect on the multiplicity of
purposes for which some metallic substance is needed, we at once
perceive that men require a metal which can not only be worked
cheaply, but must exist in great abundance, so that the needs of
a rich and varied culture may be met.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Divine Author of nature has stored away
just such a metal, and in such exhaustless quantities that it
forms an ingredient in nearly all soils, and flows away in the
waters of many springs and rivers. It exists in abundance in
nearly every country of the globe, in some forming veritable
mountain masses. We refer to iron, the king of metals; and when
man had learned to reduce it from its ores he had taken the first
step in a new direction, the end whereof is yet far distant.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have in the preceding chapter presented
some reasons why copper would be known before iron. In the first
place, how were men to learn there was such a thing as iron?
Supposing its ores did occur in abundance, there was nothing to
attract attention to them. They were not of great heft, like tin
ore or of striking color, like the ores of copper. In the hills,
and under the foot of man, nature indeed had imprisoned a genius;
but there was no outward sign by which man was to divine his
presence. Copper, as we have seen, occurs frequently in a native
form that is ready for use, without reducing from its ores.
Native iron, on the contrary, is almost the rarest of substances,
though it is reported as occurring in one or two localities on
the earth.<a href="#Refer"><sup>1</sup></a> Almost the only
examples of native iron has been obtained from meteorites.
Strange as it may seem, these wanderers in space, which
occasionally flame athwart the sky, consist largely of pure iron;
at least this is true of such specimens as have from time to time
been found on the earth's surface. This supply is of course
extremely limited, yet some Siberian tribes are said to make
knives from iron obtained in this manner.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover the evidence of language, as
used by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, would imply the
meteoric origin of the first known form of the metal.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a> But though such accidental finds might
prove the existence of another metal, they would furnish no hint
how to extract it from its ores, or indeed, that it existed in
the form of ores.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The prolonged schooling in metallurgy, which
men received during the Bronze Age, could not fail to give them
many hints, and doubtless accidental discoveries of metallic
substances were made. We can conceive how, by accident or design,
iron ore, treated in a similar manner to copper and tin ore,
would leave behind a mass of spongy iron. The difficulty would be
in working it; for, as we have seen, they were in the habit of
casting their articles of bronze. But iron is very difficult of
fusion. It was a long while before they learned how to do that.
They had therefore to learn an entirely new art&mdash;that is, to
fashion their implements of iron by hammering the heated
mass.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is no reason to suppose that iron was
first discovered in Europe. Its spread has been from the east and
south to the north and west. It, in all probability, was
discovered, like bronze, in Asia. Although evidence, both
arch&aelig;ological and traditional, goes to show that bronze was
in use long before iron, yet iron has been known from time
immemorial. Explain it how we will, civilization and history
follow close after the knowledge of iron. Wherever the light of
history first falls on the nations of the Old World, we find them
acquainted with iron, but such knowledge, at least on the part of
the Mediterranean nations, does not long precede history, for at
that early time, iron was still a most precious metal. It was not
yet produced in sufficient quantities to take the place of
bronze; hence the prehistoric Iron Age was there but of short
duration.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Among the early Egyptians iron was known, but
was probably not very common. There is on this subject some
diversity of opinion; some believing that at the very earliest
historical period they were skilled in working it, and employed
it in all the affairs of life, but others assure us that at the
most ancient period they did not really use iron, and that bronze
was the metal employed for all ordinary purposes.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A wedge of iron is said to have been found in
a joint between the stones of the great pyramid. Here, then, at
the dawn of historic times iron seems to be making its way among
a bronze-using people. The ancient Chaldeans employed iron as an
ornament, but not for implements. With them it was therefore a
precious metal. Among the Assyrians, iron was largely used, and
at a comparatively early date. A careful study of the poems of
Homer shows that the Greeks of nearly three thousand years ago
had a knowledge of iron, though it was a highly prized metal. But
to the north of the Mediterranean the prehistoric Iron Age was of
longer duration.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can readily see that a knowledge of iron
would spread in much the same way as did bronze. When first
introduced, it would be rare and costly, and so would be used
sparingly. Bronze axes have been found with the edge of iron.
Afterwards, as it became more abundant, it would be used
altogether for cutting instruments and weapons, while bronze,
being more easily worked, would still be used for ornaments,
brooches, etc. At Hallstadt, in Austria, was discovered a
cemetery which evidently belongs to a time when iron was taking
the place of bronze. In this case, the implements of bronze are
those forms which we have learned were produced near the close of
the Bronze Age. The iron implements are not those forms best
suited for that metal, but imitations of those of bronze.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a> We remember when bronze was first
introduced, the weapons were simply copies of those forms already
made in stone.<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We may suppose that a knowledge of iron would
spread rapidly. The knowledge of metallurgy necessary for the
production of bronze was at this time widely disseminated. It
would require, therefore, but a hint to start them in
experiments. In the dissemination of this knowledge, commerce, of
course, played a most important part. Whenever the early Greek
and Roman writers have occasion to mention the arms of the less
civilized tribes of Europe, we learn they were of iron. This
shows that at a very early time this knowledge had spread all
over Europe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is scarcely necessary to remark that the
use of iron would not drive out the use of bronze. That would
still be used for many purposes; and even stone would continue in
use, at least for some purposes. At the battle of Marathon,
arrow-heads and lances of stone were largely used. We can easily
understand how, by one of a number of causes, some rude tribes,
yet unacquainted with the use of metal, would come to occupy the
site of some settlement, the inhabitants of which had been in the
Bronze or Iron Age. This actually happened at ancient Troy, where
the remains of a stone-using folk have been found above those of
a people using metal. This, though an exception to the general
rule, need give us no surprise.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Iron manufacture at the present day, is one of
our great industries. In its present form it is the final
development of an industry whose first unfoldings we have now to
glance at. That the first process man employed to procure iron
should have been very rude, is what we would expect. Some of the
partially civilized tribes of to-day may give us an insight into
the process employed. We are told that in Tartary each native
makes the iron he needs, just as every household would make its
own bread. The furnace is a very small affair, not holding more
than three pounds of ore. This is filled with ore and charcoal.
The bellows are used, and after the charcoal is all burned out,
the result is a small piece of spongy iron, which needs only
repeated heating and hammering to be made serviceable.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a> Primitive furnaces, on a somewhat
larger scale, have been discovered in Switzerland. Here the
excavation was made in the side of a hill, and a rude,
dome-shaped chimney built over it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that our task ends where
the historian's begins. The use of iron did not long precede
history, so we have but little to describe as to the customs and
manners of life during the prehistoric Iron Age. A general
advance in all the social arts must surely have taken place.
Improved tools, and more cheaply produced, could not fail to
advance man very materially in culture. Some lake settlements
were still in use as places of residence, but better means of
protection than water was now known&mdash;walled cities were in
use, especially around the Mediterranean sea.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Morgan has traced for us the evolution of
government. At this early date the Greek and Roman people were
engaged in substituting for ancient society the modern idea of
government founded on territory.<a href="#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a>
The great body of European tribes were now in the final stage of
barbaric life. Their system of government was doubtless the
highest known to ancient society&mdash; that of confederacies;
the union of tribes speaking dialects of the same language, for
offensive and defensive purposes.</p>

<center><img alt="Ornaments and Gold Ornament." src=
"images/Ch8_image/Ornaments.jpg" height="435" width="328"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As characteristic of the advance of this
epoch, we may mention the appearance of pottery made on the
potter's wheel, and baked in an improved kind of furnace.
Previous to this epoch all the pottery had been moulded by hand
and baked in an imperfect manner in the open air. This may be
thought to be but a small improvement. Our civilization, however,
depends upon small improvements. Only during the early part of
this age, while iron was scarce, and therefore valuable, would it
be used for the purpose of ornaments. Iron brooches have been
found in considerable quantities in the lake settlements. Bronze
would still be the principal article used for ornaments. The
articles of bronze manufactured play a great deal of skill. Nor
was gold entirely forgotten. The cap-shaped ornament of gold was
found in Ireland. During the Bronze age, as we have seen, there
was no attempt made to represent animal forms by way of
ornaments; but we meet with such representations during the early
part of the Iron Age. This shows how they ornamented the sheath
of a sword found in one of the Swiss lakes.</p>

<center><img alt="Swords and Ornamental Sword Sheath." src=
"images/Ch8_image/Swords.jpg" height="430" width="330"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The warriors of the early Iron Age possessed
leaf-shaped swords for stabbing. The hilts were of bronze. This
period was a struggle for existence, on the part of the various
tribes of Europe. War must have been very common, so it is not
strange that a large number of relics of this age are of warlike
implements. Lance-heads, javelins, and arrow-heads have been
found in abundance. It appears, from experiments ordered by the
Emperor Napoleon III, that the javelins could only have been used
as missile weapons, and that they were thrown, not by the hand
merely grasping the shaft, but by means of a cord or thong,
something after the principle of a sling.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some years ago an old battle-field was
discovered at Tiefenau, in Switzerland. On it were found a great
number of objects made of iron, such as fragments of chariots,
bits for horses, wheels, pieces of coats of mail, and arms of
various sorts, including no less than a hundred two-handed
swords. All of these were made of iron.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a> The soldiers also carried with them
shields, made sometimes of bronze, as in the cut below, or of
wood, studded with iron.</p>

<center><img alt="Lance-head and Javelin, and Shields." src=
"images/Ch8_image/Shields.jpg" height="396" width="362"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is evidence of considerable volume of
trade at this time. The Mediterranean was the theater of an
extended commerce. Ph&oelig;nician sailors not only ventured to
brave the Mediterranean sea, but carried their vessels out on the
Atlantic at as early a date as 500 B.C. The Greek traders were
also active. Massilia, or as it is known in modern times,
Marseilles, was the seat of a thriving trade. African ivory has
been found in the tombs of Hallstadt, in Austria, in connection
with ornaments of amber from the Baltic, and gold from
Transylvania. The inhabitants of this town possessed in their
salt mines the source of a lucrative trade. The trader of the
Iron Age was able to take an immense stride by reason of the
invention of money. Heretofore, in Europe, we have not met with
coins, and trade must have been carried on by means of
barter.</p>

<img alt="Gallic Coin." src="images/Ch8_image/Coins.jpg" height="96"
width="160" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Acquainted as we are at the present day with
money and the mechanism of exchange, it is difficult to see how
any extended trade could be carried on without some unit of
value, yet no coins are known earlier than the Iron Age.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> The most ancient coins known are
Greek, and date back to the eighth century before Christ. This
coin is one found in one of the lake settlements. It is made of
bronze, and the figures are not stamped, but obtained by melting
and casting.<a href="#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> This, however, is
not a Greek coin, but a Gallic one. On the battlefield of
Tiefenau, mentioned above, several Greek coins, struck at
Massilia, were found.<a href="#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is scarcely necessary to point out, that
though iron gives its name to this age, it by no means follows
that the only difference between this and the Bronze Age is the
use of iron. "The pottery is different, the forms of the
implements and weapons are different, the ornamentation is
different, the knowledge of metallurgy was more advanced, silver
and lead were in use, letters had been invented, coins had been
struck."<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a> That wonderful
invention, the phonetic alphabet, was made during the early part
of this age. The past was no longer simply kept alive in the
memory of the living, handed down by tradition and song.
Inscriptions, and monuments, and books abounded, and we are no
longer confined to an inspection of their handiwork, or
examination of their habitations, and explanation of ancient
burial mounds for our knowledge of their life and surroundings.
It is no longer the arch&aelig;ologists' collections, but the
writings of the historian that unfolds past times and
customs.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us cast a glance at the condition of
Europe at the dawn of history. We have seen that in general terms
the Bronze Age coincided with the arrival and spread of the
Celts, though the earlier Celts were still Neolithic. The use of
iron could scarcely have been inaugurated before the innumerable
hordes of the Germanic tribes, probably driven from their Asiatic
homes by the presence of invading people, were on the march. The
world has, perhaps, never witnessed such a movement of people as
convulsed Europe for several hundred years, beginning the second
century before Christ and continuing until the fall of the
Western Empire of Rome. The light of history dawns on a stormy
scene in Europe. The Celts confined to the Western portion had
been largely subjected by the Roman armies, but the largest
portion of Europe held by the Germanic tribes was the seat from
whence assault after assault was made on the Roman Empire, which
at length, weakened by internal dissensions and enervated by
luxury, split in twain, and the western, and most important part,
fell before its barbarian foes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The various tribes could not keep alive the
civilization they had overthrown. The wandering hordes of
Germanic people could not easily forget their former barbaric
life, their marches of conquest, and careers of pillage. But the
claims of civilization, though light and pleasant, are none the
less imperative, and a people who seek her rewards must form
settled communities, develop public spirit, organize government,
and sink the individual in the public good. Not appreciating
these claims, it is not strange that the incipient civilization
nearly expired, and that the night of the Dark Ages enwrapt
Europe. From out that darkness, composed of the descendants of
the people whose culture we have been investigating, finally
emerged the medi&aelig;val nations of Europe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The review has been a pleasant one, for it is
a record of progress. The difference between the culture of the
Neolithic and the Iron Age is great, but it is simply a
development, the result of a gradual growth. Civilization and
history have only hastened this growth. If we look around us
to-day we can trace the elements of our civilization back through
the eras of history, and though the faint beginning of some can
be noticed, yet many of them come down to us from prehistoric
times. We have treated of these early people in the three stages
of culture known as the Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages. We have
seen there is no hard and fast line dividing the different stages
of culture. To borrow the words of another, these stages of
progress, like the three principal colors of the rainbow,
overlap, intermingle, and shade off the one into the other, and
yet in the main they are well defined.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We instinctively long to set bounds to the
past, to measure it by the unit of years. It affords us
satisfaction to give dates for events long since gone by. For any
event in the domain of history, it is natural and appropriate to
gratify this desire. It gives precision to our thoughts, and more
firmly fixes the march of events. But the historical portion of
human life on the globe is but a small part of the grand whole.
When we pass beyond history, or into prehistoric times, we find
ourselves utterly at a loss as to dates.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have referred in the preceding pages to the
commonly accepted belief of a few years ago, that, at most, a few
thousand years express the whole period of human life on the
globe. This was supposed to be the teaching of the Scriptures,
but Infinite Wisdom left not only his word, but he left an
imperishable record of the past in rocky strata and excavated
valley, in dripping caves and mountain masses. When it was seen
that the claims of geology for a greatly extended past, one
transcending the powers of the human mind to conceive its length,
could no longer be successfully denied, then it was that earnest
investigators in the field of human antiquity could no longer
shut their eyes to the fact that if geological evidence were
worth any thing, man must have existed in the world for a far
longer time than one covered by the brief period hitherto relied
on.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This truth is so patent and plain that it has
received the unqualified indorsement of the most learned
scholars. Distinguished divines have been amongst its able
expounders, and instead of being in opposition to the Bible, as
already stated, the earnest reader finds in the periods of the
geologists unexpected confirmation of its truths. The evidence of
an extended past for man is not, however, wholly of a geological
nature, though these have been the ones principally relied on.
The arch&aelig;ologist to-day summons to his aid the science of
language, studies into the origin of civilization and the
comparison of the different races of men, and derives from each
and all of these concurrent testimony as to a vast, shadowy, and
profound antiquity for man, one stretching way beyond the dawn of
history, far into the very night of time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we have now spent some time in tracing out
the culture of these early ages, it may be well to see if there
are any means at our command to determine the absolute chronology
of the various ages. At the very outset of our inquiry, we shall
perceive that we have no such class of facts as guided our
investigations into the age of the Paleolithic remains. We have
but to recall the situation in which the implements of that age
were found, always under such circumstances, that we see at once
that a great lapse of time has passed since they became imbedded
where found, and then the bones of the various extinct animals,
found so associated with the implements, that we are justified,
even compelled, to admit they occupied the same section of
country, and then, from a variety of causes, we are satisfied
that they occupied Europe at the close of the Glacial Age, if not
for long ages before. All this gave us a point of departure, and
we have showed with what care scholars have studied all questions
relating to the date of the Glacial Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But aside from the fact that geology points
out that a long time went by after the close of the Glacial Age
before Neolithic man arrived on the scene, we are largely
deprived of its aid in our investigations; for all the various
implements and specimens of the household industries, from which
we derive our knowledge of these latter ages, are found only in
surface deposits; that is, in the modern alluvia and silt of
river bottoms, in superficial deposits, in caves, and in
peat-bogs; and even in other instances where apparently deeply
buried, as in the submerged forest deposits of the British
coasts, we know that, geologically speaking, their age is
recent.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But in spite of these difficulties, attempts
have been made from time to time to determine the absolute
chronology of these ages. The results, however, can only be
considered as approximations of the truth. We will call attention
to some of these calculations. Their value to us consists in
showing us the methods by which this problem has been attacked,
and not in the results obtained. M. Morlot, of Switzerland, has
sought to determine this question by a study of the delta of the
Tini&egrave;re, which is a small river flowing into the lake of
Geneva. Like all mountain streams, it brings down considerable
quantities of sediment, with which it has formed a conical shaped
delta. Cuttings for a railroad exposed a fine section of this
cone, and showed that at three different times layers of
vegetable soil, which must once have been its old surface were
found.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The lowest surface was some twenty feet
beneath the present surface, and here were found relics of the
Stone Age. The second layer was at the depth of ten feet, and
contained relics of the Bronze Age. Finally the first buried
layer, three feet beneath the present surface, was found to
contain relics of the Roman Age. Obtaining from other data the
time that has elapsed since the deposits of the Roman layer, he
readily calculates the age of the Stone and Bronze layers. By
this means he obtains for the Bronze Age an antiquity of between
three and four thousand years, and for the Neolithic Age from
five to seven thousand years.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a>
M. Morlot does not claim for his calculation more than
approximate accuracy.<a href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a> But if we
were to allow it a greater accuracy than its author claims, it
would still only show us that from a period of from five to seven
thousand years ago, tribes of stone using folks lived in
Switzerland. It tells us nothing as to their first appearance, or
the total length of this age.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Other calculations of a similar nature have
been made. The Lake of Bienne, in Switzerland, has been gradually
silting up along its margins from time immemorial. About seven
hundred and fifty years ago there was an abbey built at one place
on the then existing shore of the lake. Since that time the gain
of land has been about twelve hundred feet. A considerable
distance further up the valley are found the remains of a lake
settlement of the Stone Age. If the gain of land has been
uniform, it has not been far from seven thousand years since the
lake washed round the ancient settlement. Of course the land may
have gained faster at one time than at another, but from the
general configuration of the valley it is considered that its
gain was regular.<a href="#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Skertchly, of the Geological Survey of
England, has furnished still another estimate, based on the
growth of the Fen-beds on the east coast of England. It is
sufficient to state that he also arrives at an estimate of about
seven thousand years for the Neolithic period.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> Now these results are interesting, and
their substantial agreement is, to say the least, striking. We
must remember, however, that none of them are free from error.
They may serve to clear up our thoughts on this subject, but we
notice they tell us nothing as to the beginning of the Neolithic
Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Abandoning the effort to obtain dates for the
various ages, attempts have been made to calculate the entire
interval that has elapsed since the close of the Glacial times,
and thus set bounds to the first appearance of Neolithic man. We
briefly touched on this question in determining the antiquity of
the Paleolithic Age, and we say, as far as this country was
concerned, it was comparatively a recent thing, but as for
Europe, it must be at a very remote time. M. Quatrefages has
called our attention to two investigations in Europe, which, in
order to understand this question, we will now glance at. The
waters of the Rhone carry into Lake Geneva every year quantities
of sediment. In other words, from this and other sources, the
lake is gradually being filled up. Carefully calculating the
amount carried into the lake in a year, estimates have been made
of the length of time it has taken the river to fill up the lake
as much as it has.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But in making this calculation the date
arrived at was a maximum one&mdash;that is, a point beyond which
it is not reasonable to suppose the time extended. These
calculations gave as a result one hundred thousand years. The
meaning of this is that the time elapsed since the close of the
Glacial Age was something less than the number just stated. On
the other hand, a minimum date for this time has been obtained by
estimating the amount of erosion in the valley of the River
Saone, in France. From this we know that the time can not be less
than seven thousand years.<a href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is, perhaps, doubtful whether we shall ever
be able to obtain satisfactory answers to these questions. From
what we have repeatedly seen of the slowness of development of
primitive man, we do not doubt but what the antiquity of
Neolithic Man goes much farther back than seven thousand years.
When a naturalist finds in widely separated parts of the world
animals belonging to a common order, he is justified in
concluding that the order is a very ancient one. To illustrate,
the opossum belongs to an order of animals of which the only
other representatives are found in Australia and the neighboring
islands.<a href="#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a> We are not surprised,
therefore, to learn that this order was the first to appear in
geological time.<a href="#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a> We think the
rule is equally applicable to races of men. We are told that the
Turanian race, or, as it is often named, the Mongoloid race, is a
very widely scattered one. Its representatives are found over the
larger portion of Asia, in Northern Europe, the islands of the
Pacific; and they were the only inhabitants of the New World at
the time of the conquest.<a href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a> This
wide dispersion would imply that they were one of the ancient
races of the world, and as such their antiquity must be far
greater than the above named number of years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This point grows clearer when we see what
light is afforded on this subject by historical research. The
Turanian people were in full possession of Europe while yet the
ancestors of the Hindoos and the various European nations dwelt
together as one people in Asia. As a race they had grown old when
the Celts commenced their wanderings. Egypt comes before us as a
powerful people, at a time at least as early as six thousand
years ago. Even at that time they had attained civilization. But
we need not doubt that there is a long series of years lying back
of that, during which this people were slowly advancing from a
previous condition of barbarism. The Egyptian people themselves
are, in part at least, descendants of a Turanian people that
probably in former times occupied the valley of the Nile and
North Africa.<a href="#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Geikie has lately gone over the entire
ground from the point of view of a geologist. He ranges over a
wide field, and appeals in support to writers of acknowledged
ability in all branches of learning.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a> Yet the impression we gather from his
writings is that of ill-defined, but far-reaching antiquity, one
necessary to account for the great climatic and geographical
changes which he shows us have taken place since the Glacial Age.
But he tells us that any term of years he could suggest would be
a mere guess. We can not do better than leave the matter here.
Perhaps as a result of the research of our present scholars, we
may soon have more precise results.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These closing essays have impressed on us
clearly and distinctly the isolation of the Paleolithic Age. When
we reflect on its prolonged duration, its remoteness in time, and
its complete severance from the Neolithic and succeeding ages, we
are almost ready to wonder whether they were indeed human beings.
But beginning with the Neolithic Age, we come to our own era.
This primitive culture seems to have been the commencement of our
own culture, and so the industries, household implements, and
weapons of these ages possess a greater interest to us. We have
now completed our inquiry into prehistoric life in Europe, and
are ready to turn our attention to other parts of the field. What
we have thus far learned shows us how true it is that the past of
human life on the globe is full of mystery. We trust that what
has been written will enable our readers to form clearer
conceptions of life in Europe during these far away times.</p>

<li>Mr. Southall, in "Recent Origin of Man," p. 475, quotes, from
Dr. Andrews, of Chicago, to the effect that these calculations
are very erroneous, as he thinks that M. Morlot forgot that the
size of the cone would increase more and more slowly. On the
contrary, M. Morlot says as follows: "Only this growth must have
gone on at a gradually diminishing rate, because the volume of a
cone increases as the cube of its radius. Taking this fact into
consideration, etc." (Smithsonian Report, 1860, p. 341.) There
are, however, several objections to this calculation, for which
