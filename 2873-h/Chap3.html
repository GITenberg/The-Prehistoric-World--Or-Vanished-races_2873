<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="The" src="images/Ch3_image/The.jpg" height=
"124" width="117" align="LEFT"> TERTIARY AGE, with its wonderful
wealth of animal and plant life, gradually drew to its close. In
our "Outline" we have named the period that next ensued the
Glacial Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a> This was
sufficiently exact for our purpose then, but we must remember
this is the name<a href="#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a> for a long
series of years. During this period great changes in climate
occurred. At its commencement, a genial temperate climate
prevailed throughout Europe; and this, as we know, was preceded,
during the Miocene Age, by a warm tropical one.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a> This succession, then, shows us that,
for some reason or other, the climate had been gradually growing
colder. This change went forward uninterruptedly. Doubtless very
gradually, from century to century, the seasons grew more and
more severe, until, finally, the Summer's sun no longer cleared
the mountains of the Winter's snow. This was the beginning of the
Glacial Age proper.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The best authorities also suppose that the
reign of snow and ice was broken by at least one return (possibly
more) of genial climate, when animals and plants from the south
again visited the countries of Northern Europe&mdash;only,
however, to be once more driven forth by a return of arctic cold.
But finally, before the increasing warmth of a genial Climate,
the glaciers vanished, not to return again, and the Glacial Age
became merged in that of the present.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is no longer a question that man lived in
Europe during the largest portion of this age, if not from the
beginning. It is necessary, then, to come to a clear
understanding of the successive stages of this entire age, and to
trace the wonderful cycles of climate&mdash;the strange mutation
of heat and cold, which must have exerted a powerful influence on
the life, both animal and vegetable, of the period&mdash;and see
when we first find decisive proofs of man's presence, and learn
what we can of his condition.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The map of Europe, at the close of Pliocene
times and the commencement of the Glacial Age, is of interest to
us in several ways. From this it will be seen that it was
considerably more elevated than at the present. As this is no
fancy sketch, but is based on facts, it is well to outline them.
Without the aid of man, land animals can not possibly pass from
the mainland of a continent to an island lying some distance off
the shore. But it is well known that animals like the rhinoceros,
and several others, wandered as well over the surface of the
British Islands as on the adjacent coast of Europe. We are
therefore compelled to assume, that at that time the English
Channel and the Irish Sea were not in existence. This
necessitates an elevation of at least four hundred feet, which
would also lay bare a large portion of the North Sea.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a> In proof of this latter statement is
the fact, that, at a distance from land in the North Sea,
fishermen at the present day frequently dredge up bones and teeth
of animals that then roamed in Europe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Map of Europe." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Map_of_europe.jpg" height="338" width="411"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While there is no necessity for supposing an
elevation greater than that required to lay bare a passage for
animals back and forth, yet soundings undertaken by the British
government have established the fact, that the ocean deepens very
gradually away from the shores of the main-land until a depth of
six hundred feet is reached, when the shore falls away very
suddenly. This is supposed to be the sea-coast of that time. The
English Channel would then have existed as the valley of the
Seine, and the Rhine have prolonged its flow over the present bed
of the North Sea. As the land stood at this height through a
large portion of the Glacial Age, it is not at all unreasonable
to suppose that primitive tribes hunted back and forth along
these valleys, and so doubtless many convincing proofs of their
presence at that early day lie buried underneath the waves of the
sea. In like manner, at the south, we know that elephants, lions,
and hyenas passed freely from Africa to Spain, Italy, and the
Island of Crete,<a href="#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a> and,
consequently, the Mediterranean Sea must have been bridged in one
or two places at least.<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The change from Pliocene times to early
Glacial was so gradual that quite a number of animals lived on
from one to the other, and, as we have already stated, one of
these species has even survived to our own times.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But we note the arrival in Europe of a great
number of new animals, and the diversity of species seems at
first an inexplicable riddle. The key, however, is to be found in
the great climatic changes, which we have already mentioned as
occurring during this age. On the one hand, we find such animals
as the musk-sheep, reindeer, and arctic fox, animals whose
natural home is in high northern latitudes, where snow and ice
prevail most of the year.<a href="#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a> Yet
during this age they lived in Southern France and Italy, which
must then have had a far different climate than that at
present.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Were we to confine our attention to these
alone we would be convinced that the climate of Europe at that
time was arctic in its severity. But side by side with the
remains of these animals are found others which imply an
altogether different climate. The hippopotamus, now frequenting
the rivers of Africa, during that period roamed as far north as
Yorkshire, England.<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a> This animal
could not live in a country where the cold was severe enough to
form ice on the rivers. The remains of a number of other animals
are found whose natural home is in the warm regions of the
earth.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> These two groups of
animals, one from the north and one from the south, show how
varied was the climate of Europe during the Glacial Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to these, there was also a large
number of animals whose home is in the temperate regions of the
earth&mdash;animals that thrive in neither extremes of heat and
cold. This includes a great many animals of the deer kind,
several varieties of bears and horses; in fact, the majority of
those with which we are acquainted.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, what conclusion follows from this
assemblage of animals? Many theories have been put forward in
explanation. It has been suggested that Europe at that time had a
climate not unlike that of some portions of the earth at present;
that is, a long and severe Winter was followed by a short but
warm Summer. During the Winter reindeer and other northern
animals would press from the north in search of food, but would
retire on the approach of Spring, when their feeding grounds
would in turn be occupied by bisons and animals of a southern
habitat. In confirmation of this view it is pointed out that a
vast collection of bones, from the bottom of a sink-hole or pond
in Derbyshire, England, conclusively show that in the summer-time
it was visited by bisons with their calves, and in Winter by
reindeer.<a href="#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a> This theory is open
to a great many objections. As is well known, some animals make
quite extensive migrations annually, but we can scarcely believe
that heavy, unwieldy animals like the hippopotamus, were then
such industrious travelers as to wander every year from Italy to
Northern England and return.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a>
But the very ground on which this theory rests, that of strongly
contrasted summers and winters, could not be true of Europe or
the western portions of it, owing to the presence of the Atlantic
Ocean, and the influence which it inevitably exerts on the
climate.<a href="#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a> We see, then, that the
presence of these different animals can be explained only by
supposing great secular changes in climate. Let us see if we can
strengthen this view by an appeal to the vegetation of this
period.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen how important a guide as to
climate were the remains of the vegetation of the early times. We
therefore turn with more confidence to such discoveries as will
tell us of the flora of this age. But there are many reasons why
remains of plant growth should be few. As we shall soon learn,
this was a period of flooded rivers; and in the gravels and loams
thus formed is found our principal source of information as to
the life of the age. But such a rush of waters would form
gravelly banks or great beds of loam, and would sweep any plants
which might be washed into its floods far out to sea; or if by
chance they should become buried in such gravel beds, the action
of water would speedily cause the decay of the tender portions,
such as leaves, bark, and soft wood, in which case no profitable
investigation could be made. Occasionally, however, around the
shores of old lakes, vegetable beds have been buried, and we know
that some mineral springs deposit a sort of protecting sediment
on every thing with which they come in contact. By such means, at
rare intervals, leaves, seeds, and fruits have been sealed up for
future inspection, and from a careful study of all such instances
much valuable information has been obtained. At one place in the
valley of the Seine was discovered, under a bed of tufa, the
remains of a forest growth. It is not doubted that the deposit
belongs to the Glacial Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Yet the forest growth reminds us of that
prevalent during the Miocene Age. The fig-tree, canary, laurel,
and box-tree grew in profusion. These are all southern forms. One
severe winter would kill them all, and even hard frosts would
prevent the ripening of their fruits.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Neither were the Summers hot and dry. This is
shown by the presence of numerous plants which can not thrive in
hot and dry localities, but live in the shady woods of Northern
France and Germany. The evidence of this forest growth surely
presents us an inviting picture of Europe during a portion of the
Glacial Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are not without evidence, also, of a much
more severe climate. In a lignite bed (a species of coal) found
in nearly the same latitude as the forest growth just mentioned,
we detect the presence of trees that grow only in cold northern
climates, such as birch, mountain pine, larch, and spruce.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a> And in some peat-bogs of Southern
Europe belonging to this age<a href="#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a>
are found willows now growing only in Spitzbergen, and some
species of mosses that only thrive far to the north. It is quite
evident that this deposit testifies to an altogether different
climate from that indicated by the deposit before mentioned. No
theory of migration can explain this assemblage of plants, unless
it be migration taking place very slowly, in consequence of an
equally slow change of climate.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From what we have just learned of the animals
and plants living in Europe during this age, we can frame some
conception of the different climatic conditions of Europe. On the
one hand, we have a country with a mild and genial climate. Trees
of a warm latitude were then growing as far north as Paris, and
we may well suppose Europe to have abounded in shady forests and
grassy plains, through which flowed large rivers. It was just
such a country as that in which elephants and southern animals
would flourish, while vast herds of deer and bovine animals
wandered over the entire length and breadth of the land. Where
animal life was so abundant there were sure to be carnivorous
animals also, and lions, hyenas, tigers, and other animals added
to the variety of animal life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This, however, is but one side of the picture.
The other presents us with a very different scene; instead of an
abundant forest growth, the land supported only dwarf birch,
arctic willows, and stunted mosses. Arctic animals, such as
musk-sheep and reindeer, lived all the year around in Southern
France. The woolly mammoth lived in Spain and Italy. In short,
the climate and conditions of life were vastly different in the
two stages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now turn our attention to the proofs
of glaciers in Europe, the phenomena from which this age derives
its name. Descriptions of Alpine glaciers are common enough, but
as glaciers and the Glacial Age have a great deal to do with the
antiquity of man, we can not do better than to learn what we can
of their formation, and their wonderful extension during this
period. The school-boy knows that by pressure he gives his
snowball nearly the hardness of ice. He could make it really ice
if he possessed sufficient strength. The fact is, then, that snow
under the influence of pressure passes into the form of ice. In
some cases nature does this on a large scale. Where mountains are
sufficiently elevated to raise their heads above the snow line we
know they are white all the year around with snow. What is not
blown away, evaporated, or, as an avalanche, precipitated to
lower heights, must accumulate from year to year. But the weight
pressing on the lower portions of this snow-field must soon be
considerable, and at length become so great, that the snow
changes to the form of ice. But as ice it is no longer fixed and
immovable. We need not stop to explain just how this ice-field
moves, but the fact is that, though moving very slowly, it acts
like a liquid body. It will steal away over any incline however
small, down which water would flow. Like a river it fills the
valleys leading down from the mountains. But, of course, the
lower down it flows the higher the temperature it meets, and it
will sooner or later reach a point where it will melt as fast as
it advances. This stream of ice flowing down from snow-clad
mountains is called a glacier. Those we are best acquainted with
are but puny things compared with those of the polar regions,
where in one case a great river of ice sixty miles wide, flowing
from an unknown distance, some thousands of feet in depth (or
height), pours out into the sea.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We at once perceive that such a mass of ice
could not pour down a valley without leaving unmistakable signs
of its passage. The sides of the mountains would be deeply
scarred and smoothed. Projecting knobs would be worn away. The
surface of the valley, exposed to the enormous grinding power of
the moving ice, would be crushed, pulverized, and dragged along
with it. Pieces of stone, like that here represented, would form
part of this moving <i>d&eacute;bris,</i> and as they were
crowded along they would now and then grate over another piece of
stone more firmly seated, and so their surface would be deeply
scratched in the direction of their greatest length. There is
always more or less water circulating under the Alpine glaciers,
and the streams that flow from them are always very muddy,
containing, as they do, quantities of crushed rock, sand, and
clay.</p>

<center><img alt="Scratched Stone." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Scratched_stone.jpg" height="180" width=
"291"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If, for any reason, this earthy matter was not
washed out it would form a bed of hard clay, in places packed
with these striated stones. Such beds of clay are known as "till"
or bowlder clay.<a href="#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is descriptive, though in a very general
way, of the glaciers as they exist to-day. Geologists have long
been aware of the fact that they have convincing proofs of the
former presence of glaciers in Northern Europe, where now the
climate is mild. The mountains of Scotland and Wales show as
distinct traces of glaciers as do those of the Alps. It is not
necessary, in this hasty sketch, to enumerate the many grounds on
which this conclusion rests. It is sufficient to state that by
the united labors of many investigators in that field we are in
possession of many conclusions relating to the great glaciers of
this age which almost surpass belief; and yet they are the
results of careful deductions. The former presence of this ice
sheet itself is shown in a most conclusive manner by the bowlder
clay formed underneath the great glacier, containing abundant
examples of stone showing by their scratched surface that they
have been ground along underneath the glacier. The rocks on the
sides of the mountains are scratched exactly as are those in the
Alps. By observing how high up on the mountains the stri&aelig;
are, we know the thickness of the ice-sheet; and the direction in
which it moved is shown in several ways.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Briefly, then, the geologist assures us that
when the cold of the Glacial Age was at its maximum glaciers
streamed down from all the mountains of Scotland, Wales, and
Northern England; that the ice was thick enough to overtop all
the smaller hills, and on the plains it united in one great sea
of ice some thousands of feet in thickness, that it stretched as
far south as the latitude of London, England. But that to the
west the ice streamed out across, the Irish Sea, the islands to
the west of Scotland, and ended far out into what is now the
Atlantic.<a href="#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a> But these glaciers,
vast as they were, were very small compared with the glaciers
that streamed out from the mountains of Norway and Sweden. These
great glaciers invaded England to the south- west, beat back the
glacier ice of Scotland from the floor of the North Sea, overran
Denmark, and spread their mantle of bowlder clay far south into
Germany.<a href="#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While such was the condition of things to the
north, the glaciers of the Alps were many times greater than at
present. All the valleys were filled with glacier ice, and they
spread far out on the plains of Southern Germany and westward
into France. The mountains of Southern France and the Pyrenees
also supported their separate system of glaciers. Ice also
descended from the mountains of Asia Minor and North Africa.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a> In America we meet with traces of
glaciers on a vast scale; but we can not pause to describe them
here.<a href="#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It need not surprise us, therefore, to learn
of reindeer and musk-sheep feeding on stunted herbage in what now
constitutes Southern France. When a continuous mantle of snow and
ice cloaked all Northern Europe, it is not at all surprising to
find evidence of an extremely cold climate prevailing throughout
its southern borders. We thus see how one piece of evidence fits
into another, and therefore we may, with some confidence,
endeavor to find proofs of more genial conditions when the snow
and ice disappeared, and a more luxuriant vegetation possessed
the land, and animals accustomed to warm and even tropical
countries roamed over a large extent of European territory. In
Switzerland it was long ago pointed out that after the ancient
glaciers had for a long time occupied the low grounds of that
country they, for some cause, retreated to the mountain valleys,
and allowed streams and rivers to work over the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> left behind them. At Wetzikon most
interesting conclusions have been drawn. We there learn that,
after the retreat of the glaciers, a lake occupied the place,
which in course of time became filled with peat, and that
subsequently the peat was transformed into lignite. To judge from
the remains of animals and plants, the climate must have been at
least as warm as that at present; and this condition of things
must have prevailed over a period of some thousands of years to
explain the thick deposits of peat, from which originated the
lignites.<a href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But we also know that this period came to an
end, and that once more the ice descended. This is shown by the
fact that directly overlying the lignite beds are alternating
layers of sand and gravel, and, resting on these, glacier-born
bowlders. The same conclusion follows from the discoveries made
at many other places.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Scotland it is well known that the bowlder
clay contains every now and then scattered patches of peat and
beds of soil either deposited in lakes or rivers. The only
explanation that can be given for their presence is that they
represent old land surfaces; that is, when the land was freed
from ice, and vegetation had again clothed it in a mantle of
green. In this cut is shown one of these beds. Both above and
below are the beds of bowlder clay. The peat in the centre varies
from an inch to a foot and a half in thickness, and contains many
fragments of wood, sticks, roots, etc.; and of animals, numerous
beetles were found, one kind of which frequents only places where
deer and ruminant animals abound.</p>

<center><img alt="Interglacial Bed." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Interglacial_bed.jpg" height="210" width=
"351"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From a large number of such discoveries it is
conclusively shown that, after all, Scotland was smothered under
one enormous glacier, a change of climate occurred, and the ice
melted away. Then Scotland enjoyed a climate capable of
nourishing sufficient vegetation to induce mammoths, Irish deer,
horses, and great oxen to occupy the land. But the upper bowlder
clay no less conclusively shows that once more the climate became
cold, and ice overflowed all the lowlands and buried under a new
accumulation of bowlder clay such parts of the old land surface
as it did not erode. Substantially the same set of changes are
observed in English and German geology.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Having thus given an outline of the climatic
changes which took place in Europe during the Glacial Age, and
the grounds on which these strange conclusions rest, we must now
turn our attention to the appearance of man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The uncertainties which hung over his presence
in the earlier periods, spoken of in the former chapter, do not
apply to the proofs of his presence during this age, though it is
far from settled at what particular portion of the Glacial Age he
came into Europe. We must remember we are to investigate the
past, and to awaken an interest in the history of a people who
trod this earth in ages long ago. The evidence on which we
establish a history of the early tribes of Europe is necessarily
fragmentary, but still a portion here and a piece there are found
to form one whole, and enable us to form quite a vivid conception
of manners and times now very far remote.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not claimed that we have surmounted
every difficulty&mdash;on the contrary, there is yet much to be
deciphered; but, in some respects, we are now better acquainted
with these shadowy tribes of early times than with those whose
history has been recorded by the historian's facile pen. He has
given us a record of blood. He acquaints us with the march of
vast armies, tells us of pillaged cities, and gives us the names
of a long roll of titled kings; but, unfortunately, we know
little of the home life, the occupation, or of those little
things which make up the culture of a people. But the knowledge
of primitive tribes, gathered from the scanty remains of their
implements, from a thorough exploration of their cavern homes,
has made us acquainted with much of their home life and
surroundings: and we are not entirely ignorant as to such topics
as their trade, government, and religion. We must not forget that
this is a knowledge of tribes and peoples who lived here in times
immeasurably ancient as compared with those in existence at the
very dawn of history.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must try and form a mental picture of what
was probably the primitive state of man; and a little judicious
reasoning from known facts will do much for us in this direction.
Some writers have contended that the first condition of man was
that of pleasing innocence, combined with a high degree of
enlightenment, which, owing to the wickedness of mankind, he
gradually lost. This ideal picture, however consonant with our
wishes, must not only give way before the mass of information now
at our command, but has really no foundation in reason; "or, at
any rate, if this primitive condition of innocence and
enlightenment ever existed, it must have disappeared at a period
preceding the present arch&aelig;ological investigations."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a> Nothing is plainer than that our
present civilization has been developed from barbarism, as that
was from savagism.<a href="#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a> We need go
back but a few centuries in the history of any nation, before we
find them emerging from a state of barbarism. The energy and
intelligence of the Anglo-Saxon has spread his language to the
four corners of the globe; he has converted the wilderness into
fruitful fields, and reared cities in desert lands: yet his
history strikingly illustrates our point. A century back, and we
are already in a strange land. The prominent points of present
civilization were yet unthought of. No bands of iron united
distant cities; no nerves of wire flashed electric speech. The
wealth of that day could not buy many articles conducive of
comfort, such as now grace the homes of the poor. The contrast is
still more apparent when we recall another of the countless
centuries of the past. England, with Europe, was but just
awakening to modern life. Printing had but just been invented.
Great discoveries had been made, and mankind was but just
beginning those first feeble efforts which were to bring to us
our modern comforts. But a millennium of years ago, and the
foundation of English civilization had but just been laid by the
union of the rude Germanic tribes of the Saxons and the Angles.
Similar results attend the ultimate analysis of any civilization.
It was but yesterday that wandering hordes, bound together by the
loose cohesion of tribal organization, and possessing but the
germ of modern enlightenment, held sway in what is now the
fairest portion of the world: and we, the descendants of these
rude people, must reflect that the end is not yet&mdash;that the
onward march of progress is one of ever hastening steps&mdash;and
that, in all human probability, the sun of a thousand years hence
will shine on a people whose civilization will be as superior to
ours as the light of day exceeds the mellow glow of a moon-lit
night.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If such are the changes of but a few
centuries, what must we not consider the changes to have been
during the countless ages that have sped away since man first
appeared on the scene! The early Greek and Roman writers were
much nearer right when they considered primitive man to have been
but a slight degree removed from the brute world. Horace thus
expresses himself: "When animals first crept forth from the newly
formed earth, a dumb and filthy herd, they fought for acorns and
lurking places &mdash;with their nails, and with fists&mdash;then
with clubs&mdash;and at last with arms, which, taught by
experience, they had forged. They then invented names for things,
and words to express their thoughts; after which they began to
desist from war, to fortify cities, and enact laws." The learning
of modern times leads to much the same conclusion.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is evident that primitive man must have
been destitute of metals; for it requires a great deal of
knowledge and experience to extract metals from their ores. In
the eyes of savages, the various metallic ores are simply so many
varieties of stone&mdash; much less valuable for his purposes
than flint, or some other varieties. We know it to be
historically true, that a great many nations have been discovered
utterly destitute of any knowledge of metals.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When we reflect how much of our present
enlightenment is due to the use of metals, we can readily see
that their discovery marks a most important epoch in the history
of man. There is, then, every reason to suppose that stone was a
most important article for primitive man. It was the material
with which he fought his battle for existence, and we need not be
surprised that its use extended through an enormously long period
of time. Not only was primitive man thus low down in the scale,
but of necessity his progress must have been very slow.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The time during which men were utterly
destitute of a knowledge of metals, far exceeds the interval that
has elapsed since that important discovery.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> Scholars divide the stone age into two
parts. In the first, the stone implements, are very few, of
simple shapes, and in the main formed of but one variety of
stone&mdash;generally flint~-and they were never polished. In the
second division, we meet with a great many different implements,
each adapted to a different purpose. Different varieties of stone
were employed, and they also made use of bone, shell, and wood,
which were often beautifully polished.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From what we have learned of the development
of primitive society, it will not surprise us to learn that the
first division of the age of stone comprises a vastly greater
portion of time, and is far more ancient, than the second. We
will give an outline showing the order of use of different
materials; but it is here necessary to remark that Bronze was the
first metal that man learned to use, and Iron the second.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In this outline the words Paleolithic and
Neolithic are the scientific terms for the two divisions of the
Stone Age, and will be so used in these pages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The only races of men that we could expect to
find in Europe during the Glacial Age would be Paleolithic
tribes, and it is equally manifest that we must find traces of
them in beds of this age, or in association with animals that are
characteristic of this age, or else we can not assert the
existence of man at this time. The valley of the river Somme, in
Northern France, has become classical ground to the student of
Arch&aelig;ology, since it was there that such investigations as
we have just mentioned were first and most abundantly made. It is
now well known that the surface features of a country&mdash;that
is, its hills and dales, its uplands and lowlands&mdash;are
mainly due to the erosive power of running water. Our rivers have
dug for themselves broad valleys, undermined and carried away
hills, and in general carved the surface of a country, until the
present appearance is the result. It must be confessed that when
we perceive the slow apparent change from year to year, and from
that attempt to estimate the time required to produce the effects
we see before us, we are apt to shrink from the lapse of time
demanded for its accomplishment. Let us not forget that "Time is
long," and that causes, however trifling, work stupendous results
in the course of ages.</p>

<img alt="Paleolithic Flints." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Paleolithic_flints.jpg" height="306" width="250"
align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">But a river which is thus digging down its
channel in one place, deposits the materials so dug away at other
and lower levels, as beds of sand and gravel. In the course of
time, as the river gradually lowers its channel, it will leave
behind, at varying heights along its banks, scattered patches of
such beds. Wherever we find them, no matter how far removed, or
how high above the present river, we are sure that at some time
the river flowed at that height; and standing there, we may try
and imagine how different the country must have looked before the
present deep valley was eroded.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the case of the river Somme, we have a wide
and deep valley, a large part of which has been excavated in
chalk rock, through which the river now winds its way in a
sinuous course to the English Channel. Yet we feel sure that at
some time in the past it was a mighty stream, and that its waters
surged along over a bed at least two hundred feet higher than
now. In proof of this fact we still find, at different places
along the chalky bluff, stretches of old gravel banks, laid down
there by the river, "reaching sometimes as high as two hundred
feet above the present water level, although their usual
elevation does not exceed forty feet."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The history of the investigation of the
ancient gravel beds of the Somme is briefly this: More than one
instance had been noted of the finding of flint implements,
apparently the work of men, in association with bones of various
animals, such as hyenas, mammoths, musk-sheep, and others, which,
as we have just seen, lived in Europe during the Glacial Age. In
a number of cases such finds had been made in caves. But for a
long time no one attributed any especial value to these
discoveries, and various were the explanations given to account
for such commingling. A French geologist, by the name of Boucher
DePerthes, had noted the occurrence of similar flint implements,
and bones of these extinct animals, in a gravel pit on the banks
of the Somme, near Abbeville, France. He was convinced that they
proved the existence of man at the time these ancient animals
lived in Europe. But no one paid any attention to his opinions on
this subject, and a collection of these implements, which he took
to Paris in 1839, was scarcely noticed by the scientific world.
They were certainly very rude, and presented but indistinct
traces of chipping, and perhaps it is not strange that he failed
to convince any one of their importance. He therefore determined
to make a thorough and systematic exploration of these beds at
Abbeville. In 1847 he published his great work on this subject,
giving over sixteen hundred cuts of the various articles he had
found, claiming that they were proof positive of the presence of
man when the gravels were depositing.</p>

<center><img alt="Flint Implements, so-called." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Flint_implements.jpg" height="377" width=
"380"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now there are several questions to be answered
before the conclusions of the French geologist can be accepted.
In the first place, are these so-called flint implements of human
workmanship? From our illustrations, we see that they are of an
oval shape, tending to a cutting edge all around, and generally
more or less pointed at one end. The testimony of all competent
persons who have examined them is, that however rude they may be,
they were undoubtedly fashioned by man. Dr. C. C. Abbott has made
some remarks on implements found in another locality, equally
applicable to the ones in question. He says: "We find, on
comparing a specimen of these chipped stones with an accidentally
fractured pebble, that the chipped surfaces of the former all
tend toward the production of a cutting edge, and there is no
portion of the stone detached which does not add to the
availability of the supposed implement as such; while in the case
of a pebble that has been accidentally broken, there is
necessarily all absence of design in the fracturing."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Like the watch found on the moor, they show
such manifest evidence of design, that we can not doubt that they
were produced by the hand of man. But it is not enough to know
that they are artificial, we must also know that they are of the
same age as the beds in which they are found.</p>

<center><img alt="Section of Gravel Pit." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Section_of_gravel_pit.jpg" height="306" width=
"295"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut represents a section of a gravel pit
at St. Acheul, on the Somme. The implements are nearly always
found in the lowest strata, which is a bed of gravel from ten to
fourteen feet thick. Overlying this are beds of marl, loam, and
surface soil, comprising in all a depth of fourteen feet. It has
been suggested that the implements are comparatively recent, and
have sunk down from above by their own weight, or perhaps have
been buried in artificial excavations. The beds are however too
compact to admit of any supposition that they may have been sunk
there; and if buried in any excavation, evident traces of such
excavation would have remained. We can account for their presence
there in no other way than, that when the river rolled along at
that high elevation, and deposited great beds of sand, these
implements were someway lost in its waters, and became buried in
the gravel deposits.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Finally, we have to consider the age of the
deposits. This is a question that can be answered only by
geologists, and we may be sure that more than ordinary attention
has been bestowed upon them. The remains of many animals
characteristic of the Glacial Age were found in the beds at
Abbeville. These include those of the elephants, rhinoceros,
hyenas, cave-bear, and cave-lion.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the formation of these gravel beds, ice has
undoubtedly played quite an important part. Bowlders that could
have got there only by the aid of ice, are found in several
localities. Evidence gathered from a great many different sources
all establish the fact that these gravels date as far back as the
close of the Glacial Age at least, and there are some reasons for
supposing them to be interglacial.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can easily see that the melting away of the
immense glaciers that we have been describing would produce vast
floods in the rivers, and it is perhaps owing to the presence of
such swollen rivers that are due the great beds of surface soil,
called loam or loess, found in all the river valleys of France
and Germany.<a href="#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> These deposits
frequently overlie the gravel beds. They are then of a later date
than the beds in which are found such convincing proofs of the
presence of man, and if they themselves date from the close of
the Glacial Age, it is no longer a question whether the gravel
beds themselves belong to that age. Thus we see that we can no
longer escape the conclusions of Boucher DePerthes. The discovery
of rudely worked flints in the drift of the Somme River thus
establishes the fact that some time during the Glacial Age, man
in a Paleolithic state lived in France.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Geological terms convey to us no definite
ideas as to the lapse of time, and we have an instinctive desire
to substitute for them some term of years. In most cases this is
impossible, as we have no means to measure the flight of past
time, nor are we yet prepared to discuss the question of time,
since to do so we must learn a great deal more about the cause of
the Glacial Age. We might, however, cite statements which can not
fail to impress us with the fact that a great extent of time has
passed.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the case of the river Somme we have a
valley in some places a mile or more in width, and about two
hundred feet in depth. This has mostly been excavated in chalk
rock. Taking our present large rivers as a basis, it would
require from one to two hundred thousand years for the Somme to
perform this work.<a href="#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> It will not
do, however, to take the present action of our rivers as a guide,
since we have every reason to suppose this work went forward much
more rapidly in past times. But we can not escape the conclusion
that it demands a very long time indeed to explain it. The valley
has remained in its present shape long enough to admit the
formation of great beds of peat in some portions. Peat is formed
by the decomposition of vegetable growth. Its growth is in all
cases slow, depending entirely upon local circumstances. European
scholars who have made peat formation a special study assure us
that to form such immense beds as occur near Abbeville, several
thousand years are required, even under the most favorable
conditions.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Yet we would be scarcely willing to rest such
important conclusions as the foregoing on the researches of one
individual, or in one locality. As already stated, DePerthes made
his discoveries public in 1847. Yet they were so opposed to all
that had been believed previously, that but few took the pains to
investigate for themselves. In 1853, Dr. Rigollot, of Amiens, who
had been skeptical as to DePerthes, commenced to look for himself
in the gravel beds at St. Acheul, about nine miles below
Abbeville. As might be expected, he was soon convinced.</p>

<img alt="Paleolithic Flint, England." src=
"images/Ch3_image/English_paleolith_flint.jpg" height="198" width="173"
align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">It may be said that the scientific world
formally accepted the new theory when such English scientists as
Evans, Falconer, Lyell, and Prestwich reported in its favor.
Since that time, many discoveries of ancient implements have been
made at various places in France and England under circumstances
similar to those in the valley of the Somme. In England they have
been found along almost all the rivers in the southern and south-
eastern part. One class of discoveries there gives us new ideas
as to the extent of time that has passed since they were
deposited. That is where they occur in gravel beds having no
connection with the present system of rivers. In one case the
gravel forms a hill fifteen feet high, situated in the midst of a
swampy district, surrounded on all sides by low, flat surfaces.
Several such instances could be given; but, in all such cases, we
can not doubt that, somewhere near, there once rolled the waters
of an ancient river, that man once hunted along its banks, and
that, owing to some natural cause, the waters forsook their
ancient bed&mdash;and that since then, in the slow course of
ages, the action of running water has removed so much of the
surface of the land near there, that we can not guess at its
ancient configuration: we only know, from scattered patches of
gravel, that we are standing on the banks of an ancient
water-course.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One instance, illustrative of the great change
that has come over the surface features of the country, demanding
for their accomplishment a great lapse of time, is furnished by
the Isle of Wight. That island is now separated from the mainland
by a narrow channel, called the South Hampton Water, or the
Solent Sea.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is now known that this is nothing but an
old river channel, in which the sea has usurped the place of the
river. The coast is a river embankment, with the usual
accompaniments of gravel beds, flint implements, and fresh water
shells. On the shores of the island we find the opposite bank of
the old river. A very great change must have taken place in the
surface features before the sea could have rolled in and cut off
the Isle of Wight from the mainland.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In speaking of the length of time demanded for
this change, Dr. Evans says: "Who can fully understand how
immeasurably remote was the epoch when what is now that vast bay
was high and dry land, and a long range of chalk downs, six
hundred feet above the sea, bounded the horizon on the South? And
yet that must have been the sight that met the eye of primitive
man who frequented the banks of that ancient river, which buried
their handiwork in gravels that now cap the cliffs&mdash;and of
the course of which so strange and indubitable a memorial
subsists in what has now become the Solent Sea?"<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The illustrations scattered through this essay
are representations of the stone implements found in the drift of
European rivers. During all the long course of time supposed to
be covered by the Paleolithic Age, there are but very few
evidences of any improvement, as far as we can judge from the
implements themselves. This is in itself a melancholy proof of
the low condition of man. He had made so little advance in the
scale of wisdom, he possessed so little knowledge, he was so much
a creature of instinct, that, during the thousands of years
demanded for this age, he made no appreciable progress. The
advance of the last century was many times greater than that of
the entire Paleolithic Age. A blow struck on one end of a piece
of flint will, owing to the peculiar cleavage of flint, split off
pieces called flakes. This is the simplest form of implement used
by man. It is impossible to say with certainty how they were
used; but, from the evidence observed on them, they were probably
used as scrapers. The men of that day doubtless knew some simple
method of preparing clothing from the skins of the animals they
had killed, and probably many of these sharp-rimmed flakes were
used to assist in this primitive process of tanning.</p>

<center><img alt="Flint Flakes." src="images/Ch3_image/Flint_flakes.jpg"
height="243" width="316"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When the piece of flint itself was chipped
into form, it was one whose shape would indicate a spear-head or
hatchet. We present illustrations of each. Forms intermediate
between these two are found. Some have such a thick heavy base
that it is believed they were used in the hand, and had no handle
or haft.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Others, with a cutting edge all round, may
have been provided with a handle. M. Mortillet, of France, who
has had excellent opportunities of studying this question very
thoroughly, thinks that the hatchet was the only type of
implement they possessed, and that it was used for every
conceivable purpose&mdash;but that their weapon was a club, all
traces of which have, of course, long since vanished away.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Spear Head Type and Hatchet Type." src=
"images/Ch3_image/Spear_Hatchet.jpg" height="417" width="406"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These few implements imply that their
possessors were savages like the native Australians. In this
stage of culture, man lived by hunting, and had not yet learned
to till the ground, or to seek the materials out of which his
implements were made by mining. Re merely fashioned the stones
which happened to be within reach in the shallows of rivers as
they were wanted, throwing them away after they had been used. In
this manner the large numbers which have been met with in certain
spots may be accounted for. Man at this time appears before us as
a nomad hunter, poorly equipped for the struggle of life, without
knowledge of metals, and ignorant of the art of grinding his
stone tools to a sharp edge.<a href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> Of
course we can not hope to learn much of their social condition
other than that just set forth.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">DePerthes found some flints which show
evidence of their human origin, and yet it would be very
difficult to say what was their use. He thinks they may have a
religious significance, and has set forth a great variety of
eloquent surmises respecting them. It only need be said that such
theorizing is worse than useless. That while it is very probable
these tribes had some system of belief, yet there is no good
reason for supposing these flints had any connection with it. It
has been supposed, from another series of wrought flints, that
the men of this epoch were possessed of some sentiments of art,
as pieces have been found thought to represent the forms of
animals, men's faces, birds, and fishes; but as very few have
been able to detect such resemblances, it is safe to say they do
not exist.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As the love of adornment is almost as old as
human nature itself, we may not be surprised to find traces of
its sway then. Dr. Rigollot found little bunches of shells with
holes through either end. The supposition is that these were used
as beads; which is not at all strange, considering how
instinctively savage men delight in such ornaments. These ancient
hunters made use of beads partially prepared by nature.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Europe is not the only country where the
remains of this savage race are found. They are found in the
countries bordering the Mediterranean in Northern Africa, and in
Egypt. In this latter country they are doubtless largely buried
under the immense deposits of Nile mud; yet in 1878 Professor
Haynes discovered in Upper Egypt scrapers and hatchets,
pronounced by arch&aelig;ologists to be exactly similar to those
of the river Somme. We are not informed as to their geological
age, but there can be no question that they are much older than
any monument of Egyptian civilization hitherto known.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Paleolithic implements have also been found in
Palestine and in India. In the latter country the beds are so
situated that they present the same <i>indicia,</i> of age as do
those of the Somme Valley. A great portion of the formation has
been removed, and deep valleys cut in them by running water.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> They have also been found in at
least one locality in the United States; that is in the glacial
gravel of the valley of the Delaware at Trenton, New Jersey. We
must not confound these remains with those of the Indian tribes
found scattered over a large extent of surface. Those at Trenton
also are not only in all respects, except materials, similar to
those of the Somme, but are found imbedded in a formation of
gravel that was deposited at least as far back as the close of
the Glacial Age, thus requiring the passage of the same long
series of years since they were used, as do the implements of
European rivers.<a href="#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> We must also
bear in mind that no country has been so carefully explored for
these implements as has Europe, and that the very country, Asia,
where, for many reasons, we might hope to find not only
unequivocal proofs of man's presence but from our discoveries be
able to clear up many dark points, as to the race, origin, and
fate of these primitive tribes, is yet almost a sealed book.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But the scattered discoveries we have
instanced show us that the people whose implements have been
described in this chapter were very widely dispersed over the
earth, and everything indicates that they were far removed from
us in time. The similarity in type of implements shows that,
wherever found, they were the same people, in the same low savage
state of culture&mdash;"Alike in the somber forests of oak and
pine in Great Britain, and when surrounded by the luxuriant
vegetation of the Indian jungle."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have yet two important points to consider.
The first is, what race of men were these river tribes? and
second, when did they arrive in Europe? Did they precede the
glacial cold? did they make their appearance during a warm
interglacial period? or was it not until the final retreat of the
glaciers that they first wandered into Europe? These questions
are far from settled; yet they have been the object of a great
amount of painstaking research.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To determine the first point, it is necessary
that anatomists have skeletons of the men of this age, to make a
careful study of them. But for a great many reasons, portions of
the human skeleton are very rarely found in such circumstances
that we are sure they date back to the Paleolithic Age, and
especially is this true of the men of the River Drift. In a few
instances fragmentary portions have been found.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">M. Quatrefages, of France, who is certainly a
very high authority on these points, thinks that the hunter
tribes of the River Drift belonged to the Canstadt race&mdash;"so
named from the village of Canstadt, in Germany, near which a
fossil skull was discovered in 1700, and which appears to be
closely allied to the Neanderthal skull, discovered near
Dusseldorf in 1857, and about which so much has been written."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a> Quatrefages supposes that this
type of man is still to be found in certain Australian tribes.
These are not mere guesses, but are conclusions drawn from
careful study by eminent European scholars.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is well known that a competent naturalist
needs but a single fossil bone to describe the animal itself, and
tell us its habits. So also anthropologists need but fragments of
the human skeleton, especially of the skull, to describe
characteristics of the race to which the individual belonged.</p>

<img alt="Neanderthal Man." src="images/Ch3_image/Neanderthal_man.jpg"
height="264" width="230" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut, though an ideal restoration, is a
restoration made in accordance with the results of careful study
of fragmentary skulls found in various localities in Europe. The
head and the face present a savage aspect; the body harmonized
with the head; the height was not more than five feet and a half;
yet the bones are very thick in proportion to their length, and
were evidently supplied with a powerful set of muscles, since the
little protuberances and depressions where the muscles are
attached are remarkably well developed.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a> Huxley and Quatrefages have both
pointed out that representatives of this race are to be found
among some Australian tribes. Among the races of this great
island there is one, distributed particularly in the province of
Victoria, in the neighborhood of Port Western, which reproduces
in a remarkable manner, the characters of the Canstadt race."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a> Not the least interesting result
of this discovery is the similarity of weapons and implements.
"With Mr. Lartet, we see in the obsidian lances of New Caledonia
the flint heads of the lower alluvium of the Somme. The hatchet
of certain Australians reminds us, as it did Sir Charles Lyell,
of the Abbeville hatchet.<a href="#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Yet some hesitate about accepting these
interesting inferences, thinking that the portions of the human
skeleton thus far recovered, which are beyond a doubt referable
to this period, are too fragmentary to base such important
conclusions upon. This is the view of Boyd Dawkins, who thinks
"we can not refer them to any branch of the human race now
alive."<a href="#Refer"><sup>49</sup></a> "We are without a
clew," continues he, "to the ethnology of the River Drift man,
who most probably is as completely extinct as the woolly
rhinoceros or the cave bear."<a href="#Refer"><sup>50</sup></a>
Future discoveries will probably settle this point.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is yet a much disputed point to what
particular portion of the Glacial Age we can trace the appearance
of man. We can profitably note the tendency of scientific thought
in this direction. But a short time has elapsed since a few
scholars here and there began to urge an antiquity for man
extending back beyond the commonly accepted period of six
thousand years. Though it is now well known and admitted that
there are no good grounds for this estimate, yet such was its
hold, such its sway over scientific as well as popular thought,
that an appeal to this chronology was deemed sufficient answer to
the discoveries of DePerthes, Schmerling, and others. It was but
yesterday that this popular belief was overthrown and due weight
given the discoveries of careful explorers in many branches, and
the antiquity of man referred, on indisputable grounds, to a
point of time at least as far back as the close of the preceding
geological age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It seems as if here a halt had been called,
and all possible objections are urged against a further extension
of time. It is, of course, well to be careful in this matter, and
to accept only such results as inevitably follow from well
authenticated discoveries. But it also seems to us there is no
longer any doubt that man dates back to the beginning of that
long extended time we have named the Glacial Age.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the first place, we must recall the animals
that suddenly made their appearance in Europe at the beginning of
this age. Though there were a number of species, since become
extinct, the majority of animal forms were those still living.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These are the animals with which man has
always been associated. There is therefore no longer any reason
to suppose the evolution of animal life had not reached that
stage where man was to appear. We need only recall how strongly
this point was urged in reference to the preceding geological
epoch, to see its important bearings here. Mr. Boyd Dawkins has
shown that the great majority of animals which invaded Europe at
the commencement of this age, can be traced to Northern and
Central Asia, whence, owing to climatic changes, they migrated
into Europe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Inasmuch as man seems to have been intimately
associated with these animals, it seems to us very likely that he
came with them from their home in Asia. We think the tendency of
modern discoveries is to establish the fact that man arrived in
Europe along with the great invasion of species now living.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Turning now to the authorities, we find this
to be the accepted theory of many of those competent to form an
opinion.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In England Mr. Geikie has strongly urged the
theory that the Glacial Age includes not only periods of great
cold, but also epochs of exceptional mildness; and he strongly
argues that all the evidence of the River Drift tribes can be
referred to these warm interglacial epochs; in other words, that
they were living in Europe during the Glacial Age.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In answer to this it has been stated that the
relics of River Drift tribes in Southern England overlie bowlder
clay, and must therefore be later in origin than the Glacial
Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But, Mr. Geikie and others have shown that the
ice of the last great cold did not overflow Southern England,<a
href="#Refer"><sup>58</sup></a> so that this evidence, rightly
read, was really an argument in favor of their interglacial
age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>59</sup></a> The committee appointed by
the British Association to explore the Victoria Cave, near
Settle, urge this point very strongly in their final report of
1878.<a href="#Refer"><sup>60</sup></a> To this report Mr.
Dawkins, a member of the committee, records his dissent, but in
his last great work he freely admits that man was living in
England during the Glacial Age, if he did not, in fact, precede
it.<a href="#Refer"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Skertchley, of the British coast survey,
in 1879,<a href="#Refer"><sup>62</sup></a> announced the
discovery in East Anglia of Paleolithic, implements underlying
the bowlder clay of that section. Mr. Geikie justly regards this
as a most important discovery.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Finally Mr. Dawkins, in his address as
President of the Anthropological section of the British
Association, in 1882, goes over the entire ground. After alluding
to the discovery of paleolithic implements in Egypt, India, and
America, he continues: "The identity of implements of the River
Drift hunter proves that he was in the same rude state of
civilization, if it can be called civilization, in the Old and
the New World, when the hand of the geological clock struck the
same hour. It is not a little strange that this mode of life
should have been the same in the forests of the North, and south
of the Mediterranean, in Palestine, in the tropical forests of
India, and on the western shores of the Atlantic." This, however,
is not taken as proving the identity of race, but as proving that
in this morning-time of man's existence he had nowhere advanced
beyond a low state of savagism. Mr. Dawkins then continues: "It
must be inferred from his wide-spread range that he must have
inhabited the earth for a long time, and that his dispersal took
place before the Glacial epoch in Europe and America. I therefore
feel inclined to view the River Drift hunter as having invaded
Europe in preglacial times, along with other living species which
then appeared." He also points out that the evidence is that he
lived in Europe during all the changes of that prolonged period
known as the Glacial Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Sir John Lubbock also records his assent to
these views. He says on this point: "It is, I think, more than
probable that the advent of the Glacial Period found man already
in possession of Europe."<a href="#Refer"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In our own country Prof. Powell says: "It is
now an established fact that man was widely scattered over the
earth at least as early as the beginning of the Quaternary
period, and perhaps in Pliocene times."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This completes our investigation of the men of
the River Drift. We see how, by researches of careful scholars,
our knowledge of the past has been enlarged. Though there are
many points which are as yet hidden in darkness, we are enabled
to form quite a clear mental picture of this early race. Out of
the darkness which still enshrouds the continent of Asia we see
these bands of savages wandering forth; some to Europe, Africa,
and the west; others to America and the east.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This was at a time when slowly falling
temperature but dimly prophesied a reign of arctic cold, still
far in the future. This race does not seem to have had much
capacity for advancement, since ages came and went leaving him in
the same low state. During the climax of glacial cold he
doubtless sought the southern coasts of Europe along with the
temperate species of animals. But whenever the climatic
conditions were such that these animals could find subsistence as
far north as England he accompanied them there, and so his
remains are found constantly associated with theirs throughout
Europe. Though doubtless very low in the scale, and at the very
foot of the ladder of human progress, we are acquainted with no
facts connecting them with the higher orders of animals. If such
exists, we must search for them further back in geological time.
The men of the River Drift were distinctively human beings, and
as such possessed those qualities which, developing throughout
the countless ages that have elapsed, have advanced man to his
present high position.</p>

This includes such animals as the mastodon, hipparion, and many
kinds of deer (Geikie's "Prehistoric Europe," p. 334). The
following animals survived into the Glacial Age, and some even
into Inter-glacial periods: African hippopotamus (still living),

showing the great extension of the glaciers. This map embodies
the results of the labors of a great many eminent scholars. See
also Croll's "Climate and Time;" also Wallace's "Island Life,"
pp. 102-202. We are not aware that the statements as set forth
above are seriously questioned by any geologist of note. Some
consider it quite possible that the bowlder clays of Southern
England and Central Germany were deposited during a period of
submergence from melting icebergs. (Dawkins's "Early Man in
Britain," p. 116.) But even this demands vast glaciers to the
north of this supposed submergence to produce the icebergs. The
weight of authority, however, is in favor of the glaciers.

suppose man was not associated with them, since he belongs to the

animals themselves might have been confined to Asia, there is
