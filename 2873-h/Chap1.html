"LEFT" alt="WHO"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">CAN read the book of the past? Who can tell us
the story of Creation's morn? It is, not written in history,
neither does it live in tradition. There is mystery here; but it
is hid by the darkness of bygone ages. There is a true history
here, but we have not learned well the alphabet used. Here are
doubtless wondrous scenes; but our stand-point is removed by time
so vast, the mist of years is so thick before us, that only the
ruder outlines can be determined. The delicate tracery, the body
of the picture, are hidden from our eye. The question as to the
antiquity and primitive history of man, is full of interest in
proportion as the solution is beset with difficulties. We
question the past; but only here and there a response is heard.
Surely bold is he who would attempt, from the few data at hand,
to reconstruct the history of times and people so far removed. We
quickly become convinced that many centuries, and tens of
centuries, have rolled away since man's first appearance on the
earth. We become impressed with the fact, "that multitudes of
people have moved over the surface of the Earth, and sunk into
the night of oblivion, without leaving a trace of their
existence: without a memorial through which we might have at
least learned their names." <a href="#Refer"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To think of ourselves, is to imagine for our
own nation an immortality. We are so great, so strong, surely
nothing can move us. Let us learn humility from the past: and
when, here and there, we come upon some reminder of a vanished
people, trace the proofs of a teeming population in ancient
times, and recover somewhat of a history, as true and touching as
any that poets sing, let us recognize the fact, that nations as
well as individuals pass away and are forgotten.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The past guards its secret well. To learn of
it we must seek new methods of inquiry. Discouraged by the
difficulties in the way, many have supposed it hidden from the
present by a veil which only thickens as time passes. In the
remains of prehistoric times they have failed to recognize the
pages of history. They saw only monuments of ancient skill and
perseverance: interesting sketches, not historical portraits.
Some writers have held that we must give up the story of the
past, "whether fact or chronology, doctrine or
mythology&mdash;whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, or
America&mdash;at Thebes, or Palenque&mdash;on Lycian shore, or
Salisbury plain&mdash;lost is lost and gone is gone for
evermore." Such is the lament of a gifted writer,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a> amongst the first to ponder over the
mysteries of the past. At the present day, with better means at
hand, a more hopeful view is taken. But here a caution is
necessary; for, in attempting to reconstruct the history of
primitive times, such is the interest which it inspires, that
many allow imagination to usurp the place of research, and write
in terms too glowing for history.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The human mind is sleepless in the pursuit of
knowledge. It is ever seeking new fields of conquest. It must
advance: with it, standing still is the precursor of defeat. If
necessary it invents new methods of attack, and rests not until
it gains its objective point, or demonstrates the hopelessness of
its quest. The world needs but be informed that on a given point
knowledge is dim and uncertain, when there are found earnest
minds applying to the solution of the mystery all the energies of
their natures. All the resources of science are brought to bear;
every department of knowledge is made to contribute of its store:
and soon a mass of facts is established and a new science is
added to the department of human knowledge.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, with our knowledge of prehistoric times,
what so seemingly vain as to attempt to roll back the flight of
time, and learn the condition of primeval man? All the light of
ancient history makes but little impression on the night of time.
By its aid we can but dimly see the outlines of the fortieth
century back; beyond is gloom soon lost in night. But a few short
years ago, men did not think it possible to gain further
information. With the materials at hand this could not be done.
The triumph of the intellect was simply delayed, not hopelessly
repulsed. Geology was but just beginning to make good its claim
to a place among the sciences. This unfolded to man the physical
history of the world as read from the rocks, and deals with times
so vast and profound that we speak no longer of years, but of
ages. And with the aid of Geology grand secrets were wrung from
the past, and new light was thrown on the manners and customs of
primitive man. Thus the foundation for still another science was
laid, called Arch&aelig;ology, or the science of Human
Antiquities. These two sister sciences are the keys by whose aid
we have not only acquired much information of a past that seemed
a hopeless enigma&mdash;but, as Columbus on the waste of waters
could perceive traces of land as yet invisible, so can the
present seekers after knowledge trace the signs of a satisfactory
solution of many of the great questions relating to the origin
and history of the vanished races of mankind.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In whatever land we commence our
investigations, we quickly come upon the evidences of an ancient
life long antedating all historical information. Ancient Egypt
has been a fruitful theme for the antiquarians pen. The traveler
has moralized over the ruins of her past greatness, and many
pointed illustrations of national growth and decay have been
drawn from her history.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here was the seat of an ancient civilization,
which was in the zenith of its power many centuries before
Christ. The changes that have passed over the earth since that
time are far more wonderful than any ascribed to the wand of the
magician. Nations have come and gone, and the land of the
Pharaohs has become an inheritance for strangers; new sciences
have enriched human life, and the fair structure of modern
civilization has arisen on the ruins of the past. Many centuries,
with their burden of human hopes and fears, have sped away into
the past, since "Hundred-gated Thebes" sheltered her teeming
population, where now are but a mournful group of ruins. Yet
to-day, far below the remorseless sands of her desert, we find
the rude flint-flakes that require us to carry back the time of
man's first appearance in Egypt to a past so remote that her
stately ruins become a thing of yesterday in comparison to
them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the New World, mysterious mounds and
gigantic earth-works arrest our attention. Here we find deserted
mines, and there we can trace the sites of ancient camps and
fortifications. The Indians of the prairies seem to be intruders
on a fairer civilization. We find here evidences of a teeming
population. In the presence of their imposing ruins, we can not
think that nomadic savages built them. They give evidences rather
of a people having fixed habitations and seem to imply the
possession of a higher civilization than that of the Indians.
These questions demand solution; but how shall we solve the
problem? Save here and there a deserted camp, or a burial mound,
containing perhaps articles of use or adornment, all traces have
vanished. Their earth-works and mounds are being rapidly leveled
by the plow of modern times, and the scholar of the future can
only learn from books of their mysterious builders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Mexico, and farther south, we find the
ruins of great cities. To the student of antiquity, these far
surpass in interest the ruined cities of the Nile or Euphrates
valley. Babylon of old, with its walls, towers, and pleasure
resorts, was indeed wonderful. In our own land cities, if not as
ancient, yet fallen in more picturesque ruin, reward the labors
of the explorer. Uxmal, Copan, and Palenque, invite our
attention. Here are hieroglyphics in abundance, but no Rosetta
Stone supplies the key by whose aid a Champollion can unravel the
mystery.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The luxuriant vegetative growth of the
tropics, with its fierce storms, is every year hastening the
obliteration of these ruins, and we must improve the time well,
if we would learn from them what they have to say of the
past.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The isles of the Pacific give evidence that,
long before the dawn of authentic history, man lived there.
Indeed, as the islands which gem that ocean, from their
configuration and position, seem to be but the elevated plateaus
and mountain peaks of a continent that has gone down beneath the
blue wave of the Pacific, so, throughout Polynesia can be traced
the fragmentary remains of a civilization, the greater portion of
which has been completely buried by the waters of oblivion,
leaving only here and there a trace to reconstruct, if we can,
the entire structure.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The earliest remains of man are very similar
in all lands. They consist of weapons of war and of the chase,
implements of domestic use, and articles of personal adornment.
Few and simple as they are, they are capable of imparting useful
information as to early times. By their aid we become
eye-witnesses of the daily life of primitive man. We learn that
though lacking in almost every thing we consider essential for
comfort and happiness, yet they were actuated by much the same
hopes and fears as the men of the present age. The great burden
of life was the same then as now. There was the same round of
daily labor made necessary by the same ceaseless struggle for
existence. Rude forts and warlike implements show there was the
same encroachment of the strong on the weak as now.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is a wonderful age in many respects. In
none, however, more wonderful than in the wide-spread diffusion
of knowledge. The ordinary people now understand more of nature's
secrets than the wise men of old. They are to-day interested in
researches that a former generation would have relegated to the
scholar and the man of leisure. No department of knowledge is
retained for the researches of a favored few. The farmer, the
mechanic, and the man of business are alike interested in a
knowledge of prehistoric times. The rude implements of the past
appeal to the curiosity of all. We arise from a study of the past
with clearer ideas of man's destiny. Impressed with the great
advancement in man's condition from the rude savagery of the
drift, to the enlightened civilization of to-day, what may we not
hope the advancement will be during the countless ages we believe
a beneficent Providence has in store for his creature, man?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A history of the popular opinion of the
antiquity of man is not only of interest, but should teach a
lesson to all who think others are wrong because not holding the
same views as they do. Hardly fifty years have passed since
scientific men began to attribute to the human race an antiquity
more remote than that assigned them by history and tradition. At
first these views met with general opposition, much as did the
theory of the present system of astronomy when it was first
proclaimed. We laugh now at the ignorant fear's and prejudices
used to combat both.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It was claimed that the Bible taught that man
had lived on the globe scarcely six thousand years. The Bible is
the book to which the Anglo-Saxon mind clings with the greatest
reverence. The memories of childhood are associated with its
pages, and its very appearance recalls the prayers of long ago.
It is not strange then that the Christian world guards with
jealous care against any thing which may be thought to weaken the
force of its statements.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But it is human nature to go to extremes: and,
when we give our support to one way of thinking, we find it
difficult to be patient with those of the contrary opinion.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, the researches of some of the most
eminent men and learned divines have amply shown, that there are
no data given in the Scriptures on which to base an estimate as
to the antiquity of man. Happily the Christian mind no longer
shrinks from the conclusions reached by the scientist: and,
indeed, it is the contemplation of the stupendous periods of
Geological times, and the infinite greatness of the works of
Creation as disclosed by Astronomy, with the extreme lowness of
man's first condition as made evident by Arch&aelig;ology, that
lend new force to the words, "What is man, that thou art mindful
of him!"</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The evidences on which we predicate an extreme
antiquity for man are necessarily cumulative. It is not from one
source alone that we obtain information, but from many. Eminent
men in nearly every department of knowledge have lent their aid
to the elucidation of this subject. It can only be understood by
those who will fairly weigh the facts that modern discoveries
have unrolled before their eyes. There are many who have not done
this, and are consequently unable to project their mental vision
so far back into the very night of time, as is now demanded for
the beginning of man's first appearance on the earth. And,
indeed, so enormously has this period been extended&mdash;so far
back does it require us to go&mdash;that even the most
enlightened investigator may well recoil in dismay when he first
perceives the almost infinite lapse of years that are required by
his calculation since the creation of man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">At this day the scholar must be ready to
explain the steps by which he reaches his conclusions. Not
necessarily explaining the minuti&aelig; of his journey hither,
but the main outlines of his course. This seems to call for a
slight outline of Geology. The animal and vegetable tribes which
have come and gone upon the earth, following each other like the
shadows of passing clouds on a Summer's day, have left their
remains in the rocks which at that time were forming. A close
investigation of these remains shows that they form the record
book of nature, wherein we are permitted to read somewhat of her
secrets. This had long been a sealed book to man; but science, as
we have seen, constantly extending her domain, at length taught
him the alphabet.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">And the Geologist now unfolds the past age of
our world with a variety of detail, and a certainty of conclusion
well calculated to inspire us with grateful admiration.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is no longer a question that many ages must
have rolled away, during which our world was totally unfit for
life of any kind, either animal or vegetable.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The nebular theory of Laplace, as modified by
the modern astronomers, so satisfactorily explains many of the
phenomena of the solar system, that it takes rank almost as a
demonstrated fact. According to the terms of this theory, our
Earth, now so dependent on the sun for light and warmth, was
itself a glowing orb, and as a bright star radiated its light and
heat into space. Grand conception, and probably true. It is now
useless to speculate as to how many cycles of almost infinite
years had begun and ended, before Earth's fading fires gave
notice that they must soon expire in night.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The stages through which the Earth passed in
turn await the sun, save that there is no further beneficent
luminary to give him light and heat: when time shall have
quenched his fiery glow, death and night shall reign supreme,
where now is life and light.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Time is long, and nature never hurries. She
builds for infinite years, and recks not the time of building.
The human mind is far too feeble to comprehend the duration of
time that sped away and was gone ere the slowly falling
temperature of the Earth admitted the formation of a crust over
her surface. When that came, the first great scene was closed.
The star had expired, the planet rolled in her annual course
around the still glowing central sun. Now came the formative age
of the world, when the great continents were outlined.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The atmosphere gradually freed itself from its
weight of water- vapor, the rains descended, and the ocean took
form and contour. We are concerned only with the outlines of
Geology, not with its details. It is full of the most interesting
facts, but is foreign to our present purpose. We will only say,
there is a marked progression in the scale and importance of life
forms.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The lower forms of animals appear first to be
followed in time by the higher. It is true that some forms have
survived through all the changes of Geological time to the
present: yet, speaking generally, some forms of life are peculiar
to each age, and the general phase of animal life is different
with each period. They thus form epochs in the history of the
world as read from the rocks, and though the beginning and ending
of each age may blend by insensible gradations with that of the
preceding and following, yet, taken as a whole, we observe in
each such singularities of form and structure as to give name to
each particular age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the fullness of time man appears; and it is
our pleasant task to trace the evidence of his primitive state,
his growth in culture, and his advancement made before the dawn
of history. Our inquiry, then, is as to his prehistoric state. We
use this term in the same sense as Dr. Wilson uses it: that is,
to express the whole period disclosed to us by means of
arch&aelig;ological evidence, as distinguished from what is known
through historical records. We can not doubt but that this
includes by far the largest portion of man's existence. The time
embraced within historical records, though different in different
portions of the world, is but a brief period in comparison to the
duration of time since he first went forth to possess the Earth.
If we can make plain to our readers that man has lived in the
world an extremely long time, going back indeed to a former
Geological age&mdash;that his first state was very low and
rude&mdash;that he has risen to his present high estate by means
of his own exertions continued through long ages&mdash;and from
this form a prophecy of a golden age to come in the yet distant
future, we shall feel that we have not written in vain.</p>
