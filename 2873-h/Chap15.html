"114" height="132" align="LEFT">LANDSCAPE presents varied aspects
according to the standpoint from which it is viewed. Here we have
a glimpse of hill and dale; there a stretch of running water. But
two persons, standing in the same position, owing to their
different mental temperaments, will view things in a different
light. Where one, an artist born, is carried away with the
beautiful scenery, another, with a more practical turn of mind,
perceives only its adaptability for investments. Education and
habits of life are also very potent factors in determining our
views on various questions. Scholars of wide and extended
learning differ very greatly in their views of questions deeply
affecting human interests. We know how true that is of abstruse
topics, such as religion and questions of state polity. It is
also true of the entire field of scientific research. The unknown
is a vastly greater domain than the known, and men, after deep
and patient research, adopt widely different theories to explain
the same facts.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It need, therefore, occasion no surprise to
learn that there is a great difference of opinion as to the real
state of culture among the so-called civilized tribes of Mexico
and Central America. We have incidentally mentioned this
difference in describing the ruins and their probable purpose. As
one of the objects we have in view, and perhaps the most
important one, is to learn what we can of the real state of
society amongst the prehistoric people we treat of, it becomes
necessary to examine these different views, and, if we can not
decide in our own minds what to accept as true, we will be
prepared to receive additional evidence that scholars are now
bringing forward, and know to how weigh them and compare them
with others.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It has only been within the last few years
that we have gained an insight into the peculiar organization of
Indian society. After some centuries of contact between the
various tribes of Indians and whites, their social organization
was still unknown. But we are now beginning to understand this,
and the important discovery has also been made that this same
system of government was very widely spread, indeed. This subject
has, however, been as extensively treated as is necessary in
chapter xii, so we need not stop longer. But if, with all the
light of modern learning, we have only lately gained a clear
understanding of the social organization of Indian tribes, it
need occasion no surprise, nor call for any indignant denial, to
affirm that the Spaniards totally misunderstood the social
organization of the tribes with which they came in contact in
Mexico.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must also take into consideration the
political condition of Europe at this time. Feudalism still
exercised an influence on men's minds. The Spanish writers, in
order to convey to Europeans a knowledge of the country and its
inhabitants, applied European names and phrases to American
Indian (advanced though they were) personages and institutions.
But the means employed totally defeated the object sought.
Instead of imparting a clear idea, a very erroneous one was
conveyed.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As an illustration of this abuse of language,
we might refer to the case of Montezuma, which name itself is a
corruption of the Mexican word "Motecu-zoma," meaning literally
"my wrathy chief." Mr. Bandelier<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a>
and Mr. Morgan have quite clearly shown what his real position
was. His title was "chief of men."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a> He was simply one of the two chief
executive officers of the tribe and general of the forces of the
confederacy. His office was strictly elective, and he could be
deposed for misdemeanor. Instead of giving him his proper title,
and explaining its meaning, the Spaniards bestowed on him the
title of king, which was soon enlarged to that of emperor,
European words, it will be observed, which convey an altogether
wrong idea of Mexican society. Many such illustrations could be
given.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The literature that has grown up about this
subject is very voluminous, but the authors not being acquainted
with the organization of Indian society, have not been able to
write understandingly about them. We do not flatter ourselves
that we have now solved all the difficulties of the case. But
since Mr. Morgan has succeeded in throwing such a flood of light
on the constitution of ancient society, and especially of Indian
society, and Mr. Bandelier has given us the results of his
careful investigation of the culture of the Mexicans, we feel
that a foundation has been laid for a correct understanding of
this vexed problem.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will now examine their architecture, or
style of building. In dealing with prehistoric people, we have
several times referred to the tribal state of government,
involving village life and communism in living. We have seen how
this principle enabled us to understand the condition of Europe
during the Neolithic Age. In still another place we have used
this principle to show the connection of the Pueblo Indians and
other tribes of the United States. Now we think this is the key
which is to explain many of the ruins we have described in the
preceding chapter. But another principle to be borne in mind, is
that of defense. War, we have seen, is really the normal state of
things amongst tribal communities. Therefore, either some
position naturally strong must be selected as a village site, or
the houses themselves must be fortified, after the fashion of
Indians. This will be found to explain many peculiarities in
their method of construction.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Amongst the pueblo structures of to-day, and
among the ruins of the cliff-dwellers, we have seen how compact
every thing was. The estufa, or place of council and worship, was
built in close proximity to the other building, and sometimes it
formed part of it, and we do not learn that there was any thing
distinguishing about the apartments of the chief. Further South a
change is noticed. A specialization of structures, if we may use
such an expression, has taken place, and, among the Mexicans,
three kinds of houses were distinguished. It is extremely
probable the same classification could be made elsewhere. There
was, first of all, the ordinary dwelling houses. Every vestige of
aboriginal buildings in the pueblos of Mexico has long since
disappeared, and our knowledge of these structures can only be
gathered from the somewhat confused accounts of the early
writers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Many, perhaps most, of the houses had a
terraced, pyramidal foundation. Some were constructed on three
sides of a court, like those on the Rio Chaco, in New Mexico.
Others probably surrounded an open court, or quadrangle. The
houses were of one and two stories in height. When two stories,
the upper one receded from the first, probably in the terraced
form. As serving to connect them with the more ornamental
structures in Yucatan, we are told they were sometimes "adorned
with elegant cornices and stucco designs of flowers and animals,
which were often painted with brilliant colors. Prominent among
these figures was the coiling serpent."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a> After pointing out, by many citations,
that the evidence always was that these houses were occupied by
many families, Mr. Morgan concludes, "They were evidently joint
tenement-houses of the aboriginal American model, each occupied
by a number of families ranging from five and ten to one hundred,
and perhaps, in some cases, two hundred families in a house."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can discern this kind of dwelling-house in
many of the descriptions we have given of the ruins in the
preceding chapter. M. Charney evidently found them at Tulla and
Teotihuacan. Mr. Bandelier concludes that similar ruins once
crowded the terraces at Cholula, and that to this class belongs
the ruins at Mitla. The Palace, at Palenque, is evidently but
another instance, as well as the House of Nuns, at Uxmal. In
fact, with our present knowledge of the pueblos of Arizona, and
the purposes which they subserved, as well as the uses made of
such houses by the Mexicans, we are no longer justified in
bestowing upon the structures in Yucatan the name of palaces.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The mistake was excusable among the Spaniards.
They were totally ignorant of the mode of life indicated by these
joint tenement-houses. When they found one of these large
structures, capable of accommodating several hundred occupants,
with its inner court, terraced foundation, and ornamented by
stucco work, or sculpture, it was extremely natural that they
should call it a palace, and cast about for some titled
owner.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A second class of houses includes public
buildings. The Mexicans, when at the height of their power,
required buildings for public use, and this was doubtless true of
the people who inhabited Uxmal and Palenque. The most important
house was the tecpan, the official house of the tribe, the
council house proper. This was the official residence of the
"chief of men" and his assistants, such as runners. This was the
place of meeting of the council of chiefs. It was here that the
hospitality of the Pueblo was exercised. Official visitors from
other tribes and traders from a distance were provided with
accommodations here. When Cortez and his followers entered Mexico
they were provided for at the tecpan. We would not expect to find
these public buildings, except in rich and prosperous pueblos. It
has been suggested that the Governor's House at Uxmal was the
official house of that settlement. The large halls, suitable for
council purposes, favor this idea.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A third class of buildings was the teocalli,
or "House of God"&mdash;in other words, the temple. These were
quite common. Each of the gens that composed the Mexican tribe
had its own particular medicine lodge or temple. This was
doubtless true of each and every tribe of sedentary Indians in
the territory we are describing. "The larger temples were usually
built upon pyramidal parallelograms, square or oblong, and
consisted of a series of superimposed terraces with perpendicular
or sloping sides."<a href="#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a> It is not
necessary to dwell longer on this style of buildings. We have
only to recall the temples of the Sun, of the Cross, and of the
Beau-relief at Palenque; the House of the Dwarf at Uxmal, and the
Citadel at Chichen-Itza, to gather a clear idea of their
construction.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The architecture of a people is a very good
exponent of their culture. Yet all have seen what different views
are held as to the culture of the tribes we are considering. We
have, perhaps, said all that is required on this part of the
subject, yet even repetition is pardonable if it enables us to
more clearly understand our subject. The ornamentation on the
ruins of Yucatan is so peculiar that in our opinion it has unduly
influenced the judgment of explorers in this matter. They lose
sight of the fact that the apartments of the houses are small,
dark, and illy ventilated.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">That they should hive gone to the trouble of
so profusely decorating their usual places of abode is, indeed,
somewhat singular.<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a> But Mitla was
certainly an inhabited pueblo at the time of the Spanish
conquest, and there is no good reason for concluding it was ever
any thing more than a group of communal buildings. Yet, from the
description given of it, we can not see that the buildings are
greatly inferior in decoration to the structures in Yucatan. And
yet again, from the imperfect accounts we have of the aboriginal
structures in the pueblo of Mexico, we infer they were
constructed on the general plan of communal buildings. As for the
decorations, we have seen they had sometimes elaborate cornices,
and were covered with stucco designs of animals and flowers. In
this case some of them were, to be sure, public buildings for
tribal purposes, but the majority of them were certainly communal
residences. With these facts before us, we can not do otherwise
than conclude that these so-called ruins of great cities we have
described are simply the ruins of pueblos, consisting of communal
houses, temples, and, in the case of large and powerful tribes,
official houses. To this conclusion we believe American scholars
are tending more and more.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This requires us to dismiss the idea that the
majority of the people lived in houses of a poorer construction,
which have since disappeared, leaving the ruins of the houses of
the nobles. There was no such class division of the people as
this would signify. These ruins were houses occupied by the
people in common. With this understanding, a questioning of the
ruins can not fail to give us some useful hints. We are struck
with their ingenuity as builders. They made use of the best
material at hand. In Arizona the dry climate permits of the use
of adobe bricks, which were employed, though stone was also used.
Further south the pouring tropical rains would soon bring down in
ruins adobe structures and so stone alone is used.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the Arizona pueblo we have a great
fortress-built house, three and four stories high, and no mode of
access to the lower story. This is in strict accord with Indian
principles of defense, which consists in elevated positions.
Sometimes this elevated position was a natural hill, as at
Quemada, Tezcocingo, and Xochicalco. Where no hill was at hand
they formed a terraced pyramidal foundation, as at Copan,
Palenque, and Uxmal. In the highest forms of this architecture
this elevation is faced with stone, or even composed throughout
of stone, as in the case of the House of Nuns at Chichen-Itza. In
the construction of houses progress seems to have taken place in
two directions. The rooms increased in size. In some of the
oldest pueblo structures in Arizona the rooms were more like a
cluster of cells than any thing else.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">They grow larger towards the South. In the
house at Teotihuacan M. Charney found a room twenty-seven feet
wide by forty-one feet long. Two of the rooms in the Governor's
House at Uxmal are sixty feet long. But the buildings themselves
diminish in size. In Mexico the majority of the houses were but
one story high, and but very few more than two stories. In
Yucatan but few instances are recorded of houses two stories
high. We must remember that throughout the entire territory we
are considering the tribes had no domestic animals, their
agriculture was in a rude state, and they were practically
destitute of metals.<a href="#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a> They could
have been no farther advanced on the road to civilization than
were the various tribes of Europe during the Bronze Age.
Remembering this, we can not fail to be impressed with the
ingenuity, patient toil, and artistic taste they displayed in the
construction and decoration of their edifices.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It may seem somewhat singular that we should
treat of their architecture before we do of their system of
government, but we were already acquainted with the ruins of the
former. When we turn to the latter we find ourselves involved in
very great difficulties. The description given of Mexican society
by the majority of writers on these topics represent it as that
of a powerful monarchy. The historian Prescott, in his charming
work<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a> draws a picture that would
not suffer by comparison with the despotic magnificence of
Oriental lands. At a later date Mr. Bancroft, supporting himself
by an appeal to a formidable list of authorities, regilds the
scene.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> But protests against
such views are not wanting. Robertson, in his history, though
bowing to the weight of authority can not forbear expressing his
conviction that there had been some exaggeration in the splendid
description of their government and manners.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> Wilson, more skeptical, and bolder,
utterly repudiates the old accounts, and refuses to believe the
Aztecs were any thing more than savages.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With such divergent and conflicting views, we
at once perceive the necessity of carefully scanning all the
accounts given, and make them conform, if possible, to what is
known of Indian institutions and manners. The Mexicans are but
one of several tribes that are the subjects of our research; but
their institutions are better known than the others, and, in a
general way, whatever is true of them will be true of the rest.
We have seen the efforts of the Spanish explorers to explain
whatever they found new or strange in America by Spanish words,
and the results of such procedure. We are at full liberty to
reject their conclusions and start anew.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What the Spaniards found around the lakes of
Mexico was a union or confederacy of three tribes. Very late
investigations by Mr. Bandelier have established the presence of
the usual subdivisions of the tribes. So we have here a complete
organization according to the terms of ancient society: that is,
the gens, phratry, tribe, and confederacy of tribes. It is
necessary that we spend some time with each of these subdivisions
before we can understand the condition of society among the
Mexicans, and, in all probability, the society among all of the
civilized nations of Central America.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will begin with the gens, or the lowest
division of the tribe. We must understand its organization before
we can understand that of a tribe, and we must master the tribal
organization before attempting to learn the workings of the
confederacy. To neglect this order, and commence at the top of
the series, is to make the same mistake that the older writers
did in their studies into this culture. A gens has certain
rights, duties, and privileges which belong to the whole gens,
and we will consider some of the more important in their proper
place. We must understand by a gens a collection of persons who
are considered to be all related to each other. An Indian could
not, of his own will, transfer himself from one gens to another.
He remained a member of the gens into which he was born. He
might, by a formal act of adoption, become a member of another
gens; or he might, in certain contingencies, lose his connection
with a gens and become an outcast. There is no such thing as
privileged classes in a gens. All its members stand on an equal
footing. The council of the gens is the supreme ruling power in
the gens. Among some of the northern tribes, all the members in
the gens, both male and female, had a voice in this council. In
the Mexican gens, the council itself was more restricted. The old
men, medicine men, and distinguished men met in council&mdash;but
even here, on important occasions, the whole gens met in
council.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Each gens would, of course, elect its own
officers. They could remove them from office as well, whenever
occasion required. The Mexican gentes elected two officers. One
of these corresponded to the sachem among northern tribes. His
residence was the official house of the gens. He had in charge
the stores of the gens; and, in unimportant cases, he exercised
the powers of a judge. The other officer was the war-chief. In
times of war he commanded the forces of the gens. In times of
peace he was, so to speak, the sheriff of the gens.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The next division of the tribe was the
phratry&mdash;the word properly meaning a brotherhood. Referring
to the outline below, we notice that the eight gentes were
reunited into two phratries. Mr. Morgan tells us that the
probable origin of phratries was from the subdivision of an
original gens. Thus a tradition of the Seneca Indians affirms
that the Bear and the Deer gentes were the original gentes of
that tribe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a> In process of time
they split up into eight gentes, which would each have all the
rights and duties of an original gens&mdash;but, for certain
purposes, they were still organized into two divisions.</p>

<br>
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of these larger groups is called a
phratry. All of the Iroquois tribes were organized into
phratries, and the same was, doubtless, true of the majority of
the tribes of North America. The researches of Mr. Bandelier have
quite conclusively established the fact, that the ancient Mexican
tribe consisted of twenty gentes reunited as four phratries,
which constituted the four quarters of the Pueblo of Mexico.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is somewhat difficult to understand just
what the rights and duties of a phratry were. This division does
not exist in all tribes. But, as it was present among the
Mexicans, we must learn what we can of its powers. Among the
Iroquois the phratry was apparent chiefly in religious matters,
and in social games. They did not elect any war-chief. The
Mexican phratry was largely concerned with military matters. The
forces of each phratry went out to war as separate divisions.
They had their own costumes and banners. The four phratries chose
each their war-chief, who commanded their forces in the field,
and who, as commander, was the superior of the war-chiefs of the
gentes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In time of peace, they acted as the executors
of tribal justice. They belonged to the highest grade of
war-chiefs in Mexico&mdash;but there was nothing hereditary about
their offices. They were strictly elective, and could be deposed
for cause. They were in no case appointed by a higher authority.
One of these chiefs was always elected to fill the office of
"Chief of Men;"<a href="#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a> and, in cases
of emergency, they could take his place&mdash;but this would be
only a temporary arrangement.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Ascending the scale, the next term of the
series is the tribe. The Spanish writers took notice of a tribe,
but failed to notice the gens and phratry. This is not to be
considered a singular thing. The Iroquois were under the
observation of our own people two hundred years before the
discovery was made in reference to them. "The existence among
them of clans, named after animals, was pointed out at an early
day, but without suspecting that it was the unit of a social
system upon which both the tribe and the confederacy rested."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a> But, being ignorant of this fact,
it is not singular that they made serious mistakes in their
description of the government.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We now know that the Mexican tribe was
composed of an association of twenty gentes, that each of these
gens was an independent unit, and that all of its members stood
on an equal footing. This, at the outset, does away with the idea
of a monarchy. Each gens would, of course, have an equal share in
the government. This was effected by means of a council composed
of delegates from each gens. There is no doubt whatever of the
existence of this council among the Mexicans. "Every tribe in
Mexico and Central America, beyond a reasonable doubt, had its
council of chiefs. It was the governing body of the tribe, and a
constant phenomenon in all parts of aboriginal America."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a> The Spanish writers knew of the
existence of this council, but mistook its function. They
generally treat of it as an advisory board of ministers appointed
by the "king."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of the Mexican gens was represented in
this council by a "Speaking Chief," who, of course was elected by
the gens he represented. All tribal matters were under the
control of this council. Questions of peace and war, and the
distribution of tribute, were decided by the council. They also
had judicial duties to perform. Disputes between different gentes
were adjusted by them. They also would have jurisdiction of all
crimes committed by those unfortunate individuals who were not
members of any gens, and of crimes committed on territory not
belonging to any gens, such as the Teocalli, Market-place, and
Tecpan.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The council must have regular stated times of
meeting; they could be called together at any time. At the time
of Cortez's visits they met daily. This council was, of course,
supreme in all questions coming before it; but every eighty days
there was a council extraordinary. This included the members of
the council proper, the war-chiefs of the four phratries, the
war-chiefs of the gentes, and the leading medicine men. Any
important cause could be reserved for this meeting, or, if agreed
upon, a reconsideration of a cause could be had. We must
understand that the tribal council could not interfere in any
matter referring solely to a gens; that would be settled by the
gens itself.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The important points to be noticed are, that
it was an elective body, representing independent groups, and
that it had supreme authority. But the tribes needed officers to
execute the decrees of the council. Speaking of the Northern
tribes, Mr. Morgan says, "In some Indian tribes, one of the
sachems was recognized as its head chief; and so superior in rank
to his associates. A need existed, to some extent for an official
head of the tribe, to represent it when the council was not in
session. But the duties and powers of the office were slight.
Although the council was superior in authority, it was rarely in
session, and questions might arise demanding the provisional
action of some one authorized to represent the tribe, subject to
the ratification of his acts by the council."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This need was still more urgent among the
Mexicans; accordingly we find they elected two officials for this
purpose. It seems this habit of electing two chief executives was
quite a common one among the tribes of Mexico and Central
America. We have already noticed that the Mexican gentes elected
two such officers for their purpose. We are further told that the
Iroquois appointed two head war-chiefs to command the forces of
the confederacy.<a href="#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the chiefs so elected by the Mexicans
bore the somewhat singular title of "Snake-woman." He was
properly the head-chief of the Mexicans. He was chairman of the
council and announced its decrees. He was responsible to the
council for the tribute received, as far as it was applied to
tribal requirements, and for a faithful distribution of the
remainder among the gentes. When the forces of the confederacy
went out to war, he commanded the tribal forces of Mexico; but on
other occasions this duty was fulfilled by his colleague, who was
the real war-chief of the Mexicans. His title was "Chief-of-men."
This is the official who appears in history as the "King of
Mexico," sometimes, even, as "Emperor of Anahuac." The fact is,
he was one of two equal chiefs; he held an elective office, and
was subordinate to the council.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When the confederacy was formed, the command
of its forces was given to the war-chief of the Mexicans; thus he
was something more than a tribal officer. His residence was the
official house of the tribe. "He was to be present day and night
at this abode, which was the center wherein converged the threads
of information brought by traders, gatherers of tribute, scouts
and spies, as well as all messages sent to, or received from,
neighboring friendly or hostile tribes. Every such message came
directly to the 'Chief-of-men,' whose duty it was, before acting,
to present its import to the 'Snake-woman,' and, through him,
call together the council." He might be present at the council,
but his presence was not required, nor did his vote weigh any
more than any other member of the council, only, of course, from
the position he occupied, his opinion would be much respected. He
provided for the execution of the council's conclusions. In case
of warp he would call out the forces of the confederacy for
assistance. As the procurement of substance by means of tribute
was one of the great objects of the confederacy, the gathering of
it was placed under the control of the war-chief, who was
therefore the official head of the tribute-gatherers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have thus very imperfectly and hastily
sketched the governmental organization of the Mexican tribe. It
is something very different from an empire. It was a democratic
organization. There was not an officer in it but what held his
office by election. This, to some, may seem improbable, because
the Spaniards have described a different state of things. We have
already mentioned one reason why they should do so&mdash;that was
their ignorance of Indian institutions. We must also consider the
natural bias of their minds. The rule of Charles the V was any
thing but liberal. It was a part of their education to believe
that a monarchical form of government was just the thing; they
were accordingly prepared to see monarchical institutions,
whether they existed or not.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Then there was the perfectly natural
disposition to exaggerate their achievements. To spread in Europe
the report that they had subverted a powerfully organized
monarchy, having an emperor, a full line of nobles, orders of
chivalry, and a standing army, certainly sounded much better than
the plain statement that they had succeeded in disjointing a
loosely connected confederacy, captured and put to death the head
war chief of the principal tribe, and destroyed the communal
buildings of their pueblo.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that, from an Indian point
of view, the confederacy was composed of rich and powerful
tribes. This is especially true of the Mexicans. The position
they held, from a defensive standpoint, was one of the strongest
ever held by Indians. They received a large amount of tribute
from subject tribes, along with the hearty hatred of the same.
From the time Cortez landed on the shore he had heard accounts of
the wealth, power, and cruelty of the Mexicans. When he arrived
before Mexico the "Chief-of-men," Montezuma, as representative of
tribal hospitality, went forth to meet him, extending "unusual
courtesies to unusual, mysterious, and therefore dreaded,
guests." We may well imagine that he was decked out in all the
finery his office could raise, and that he put on as much style
and "court etiquette" as their knowledge and manner of life would
stand.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Spaniards immediately concluded that he
was king, and so he was given undue prominence. They subsequently
learned of the council, and recognized the fact that it was
really the supreme power. They learned of the office of
"Snake-woman," and acknowledged that his power was equal to that
of the "Chief-of-men." They even had some ideas of phratries and
gentes. But, having once made up their minds that this was a
monarchy, and Montezuma the monarch, they were loath to change
their views, or, rather, they tried to explain all on this
supposition, and the result is the confused and contradictory
accounts given of these officials and divisions of the people.
But every thing tending to add glory to the "Empire of Montezuma"
was caught up and dilated upon. And so have come down to us the
commonly accepted ideas of the government of the ancient
Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">That these views are altogether erroneous is
no longer doubted by some of the very best American scholars. The
organization set forth in this chapter is one not only in accord
with the results obtained by the latest research in the field of
ancient society, but a careful reading of the accounts of the
Spanish writers leads to the same conclusions.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> In view of these now admitted facts,
it seems to us useless to longer speak of the government of the
Mexicans as that of an empire.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have as yet said nothing of the league or
confederacy of the three tribes of Mexico, Tezcuco, and Tlacopan;
nor is it necessary to dwell at any great length on this
confederacy now. They were perfectly independent of each other as
regards tribal affairs; and for the purpose of government, were
organized in exactly the same way as were the Mexicans. The
stories told of the glories, the riches, and power of the kings
of Tezcuco, if any thing, outrank those of Mexico. We may dismiss
them as utterly unreliable. Tribal organization resting on
phratries and gentes, and the consequent government by the
council of the tribe was all the Spaniards found. These three
tribes, speaking dialects of the same stock language, inhabiting
contiguous territory, formed a league for offensive and defensive
purposes. The commander-in-chief of the forces raised for this
purpose was the "Chief-of-men" of the Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have confined our researches to the
Mexicans. Mr. Bandelier, speaking of the tribes of Mexico,
remarks: "There is no need of proving the fact that the several
tribes of the valley had identical customs, and that their
institutions had reached about the same degree of development."
Or if such proofs were needed, Mr. Bancroft has furnished them.
So that this state of society being proven among the Mexicans, it
may be considered as established among the Nahua tribes. Neither
is there any necessity of showing that substantially the same
state of government existed among the Mayas of Yucatan. This is
shown by their architecture, by their early traditions, and by
many statements in the writings of the early historians. These
can only be understood and explained by supposing the same social
organization existed among them as among the Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But this does not relegate these civilized
nations to savagism. On the other hand, it is exactly the form of
government we would expect to find among them. They were not
further along than the Middle Status of barbarism. They were
slowly advancing on the road that leads to civilization, and
their form of government was one exactly suited to their needs,
and one in keeping with their state of architecture. When we gaze
at the ruins of their material structures, we must consider that
before us are not the only ruins wrought by the Spaniards; the
native institutions were doomed as well. Traces of this early
state of society are, however, still recoverable, and we must
study them well to learn their secret.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have yet before us a large field to
investigate; that is, the advance made in the arts of living
among these people. This is one of the principal objects of our
present research. We are here slightly departing from the
prehistoric field, and entering the domain of history. But the
departure is justifiable, as it serves to light up an extensive
field, that is, the manner of life among the civilized nations
just before the coming of the Spaniards. And first we will
examine their customs in regard to property. We have in a former
chapter reverted to the influence of commerce and trade in
advancing culture. The desire for wealth and property which is
such a controlling power to-day was one of the most efficient
agents in advancing man from savagism to civilization. The idea
of property, which scarcely had an existence during that period
of savagism, had grown stronger with every advance in culture.
"Beginning in feebleness, it has ended in becoming the master
passion of the human mind."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The property of savages is limited to a few
articles of personal use; consequently, their ideas as to its
value, and the principles of inheritance, are feeble. They can
scarcely be said to have any idea as to property in lands, though
the tribe may lay claim to certain hunting-grounds as their own.
As soon as the organization of gens arose, we can see that it
would affect their ideas of property. The gens, we must remember,
was the unit of their social organization.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">They had common rights, duties, and
privileges, as well as common supplies; and hence the idea arose
that the property of the members of a gens belonged to the gens.
At the death of an individual, his personal property would be
divided among the remaining members of the gens. "Practically,"
says Mr. Morgan, "they were appropriated by the nearest of kin;
but the principle was general that the property should remain in
the gens."<a href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a> That this is a true
statement there is not the shadow of a doubt. This was the
general rule of inheritance among the Indian tribes of North
America. As time passed on, and the tribes learned to cultivate
the land, some idea of real property would arise&mdash;but not of
personal ownership.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is quite an important topic; because,
when we read of lords with great estates, we are puzzled to know
how to reconcile such statements with what we now know of the
nature of Mexican tribal organization. Mr. Bandelier has lately
gone over the entire subject. He finds that the territory on
which the Mexicans originally settled was a marshy expanse of
land which the surrounding tribes did not value enough to
claim.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This territory was divided among the four
gentes of the tribe. As we have already seen, each of these four
gentes subsequently split up into other independent gentes until
there were twenty in all. Each of these gens held and possessed a
portion of the original soil. This division of the soil must have
been made by tacit consent. The tribe claimed no ownership of
these tracts, still less did the head-chief. Furthermore, the
only right the gentes claimed in them was a possessory one. "They
had no idea of sale or barter, or conveyance, or alienation." As
the members of a gens stood on equal footing, this tract would be
still further divided for individual use. This division would be
made by the council of the gens. But we must notice the
individual acquired no other right to this tract of land than a
right to cultivate it&mdash;which right, if he failed to improve,
he lost. He could, however, have some one else to till it for
him. The son could inherit a father's right to a tract.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that the Mexicans had a great
volume of tribal business to transact, which required the
presence of an official household at the tecpan. Then the proper
exercise of tribal hospitality required a large store of
provisions. To meet this demand, certain tracts of the territory
of each gens were set aside to be worked by communal labor. Then,
besides the various officers of the gens, and the tribe, who, by
reason of their public duties, had no time to till the tracts to
which, as members of a gens, they would be entitled, had the same
tilled for them by communal labor. This was not an act of
vassalage, but a payment for public duties.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is a very brief statement of their
customs as regards holding of lands. It gives us an insight into
the workings of ancient society. It shows us what a strong
feature of this society was the gens, and we see how necessary it
is to understand the nature of a gens before attempting to
understand ancient society. We see that, among the civilized
nations of Mexico and Central America, they had not yet risen to
the conception of ownership in the soil. No chief, or other
officer, held large estates. The possessory right in the soil was
vested in the gens composing the tribe, and they in turn granted
to individuals certain definite lots for the purpose of culture.
A chief had no more right in this direction than a common
warrior. We can easily see how the Spaniards made their mistake.
They found a community of persons holding land in common, which
the individuals could not alienate. They noticed one person among
them whom the others acknowledged as chief. They immediately
jumped to the conclusion that this chief was a great "lord," that
the land was a "feudal estate," and that the persons who held it
were "vassals" to the aforesaid "lord."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now consider the subject of laws, and
the methods of enforcing justice amongst the civilized nations.
The laws of the Mexicans, like those of most barbarous people,
are apt to strike us as being very severe; but good reasons,
according to their way of thinking, exist for such severity. The
gens is the unit of social organization; which fact must be
constantly borne in mind in considering their laws. In civilized
society, the State assumes protection of person and property;
but, in a tribal state of society, this protection is afforded by
the gens. Hence, "to wrong a person was to wrong his gens; and to
support a person was to stand behind him with the entire array of
his gentile kindred."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The punishment for theft varied according to
the value of the article stolen. If it were small and could be
returned, that settled the matter. In cases of greater value it
was different. In some cases the thief became bondsman for the
original owner. In still others, he suffered death. This was the
case where he stole articles set aside for religion&mdash;such as
gold and silver, or captives taken in war; or, if the theft were
committed in the market-place. Murder and homicide were always
punished with death. According to their teaching, there was a
great gulf between the two sexes. Hence, for a person of one sex
to assume the dress of the other sex was an insult to the whole
gens&mdash;the penalty was death. Drunkenness was an offense
severely punished&mdash;though aged persons could indulge their
appetite, and, during times of festivities, others could. Chiefs
and other officials were publicly degraded for this crime. Common
warriors had their heads shaved in punishment.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These various penalties necessarily suppose
judicial officers to determine the offense and decree the
punishment. Having established, on a satisfactory basis, the
Mexican empire, the historians did not scruple to fit it out with
the necessary working machinery of such an organization.
Accordingly we are presented with a judiciary as nicely
proportioned as in the most favored nations of to-day. But when,
under the more searching light of modern scholarship, this empire
is seen to be something quite different, we find the whole
judicial machinery to be a much more simple affair.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Not much need be added on this point to what
we have already mentioned. Each gens, through its council, would
regulate its own affairs, and would punish all offenses against
the law committed by one of its members against another. Of
necessity the decision of this council had to be final. There was
no appeal from its decision. The council of the tribe had
jurisdiction in all other cases&mdash;such as might arise between
members of different gentes, or among outcasts not connected with
any gens, or such as were committed on territory not belonging to
any gens.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For this work, the twenty chiefs composing the
council were subdivided into two bodies, sitting simultaneously
in the different halls of the tecpan. This division was for the
purpose of greater dispatch in business. They did not form a
higher and lower court, with power of the one to review the
decisions of the other. They were equal in power and the
decisions of both were final. The decision of the council, when
acting in a judicial capacity, would be announced by their
foreman, who was, as we have seen, the head-chief of the
Mexicans&mdash;the Snake-woman. It is for this act that the
historian speaks of him as the supreme judge, and makes him the
head of judicial authority.<a href="#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a> His
decisions were, of course, final, not because he made them, but
because they were the conclusions of the council.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The "Chief-of-men," the so-called "king," did
not properly have any judicial authority. He was their war-chief,
and not a judge; but from the very nature of his office he had
some powers in this direction. As commander-in-chief, he
possessed authority to summarily punish (with death, if
necessary) acts of insubordination and treachery during war. It
was necessary to clothe him with a certain amount of
discretionary power for the public good. Thus, the first runner
that arrived from the coast with news of the approach of the
European ships was, by the order of Montezuma, placed in
confinement. "This was done to keep the news secret until the
matter could be investigated, and was therefore a preliminary
measure of policy." Placed at the tecpan as the official head of
the tribe, he had power to appoint his assistants. But this power
to appoint implied equal power to remove, and to punish.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This investigation into their laws and methods
of enforcing them, carries us to the conclusion already arrived
at. It is in full keeping with what we would expect of a people
in the Middle Status of barbarism. We also see how little real
foundation there is for the view that this was a monarchy. There
is no doubt but that the pueblo of Mexico was the seat of one of
the largest and most powerful tribes, and the leading member of
one of the most powerful confederacies that had ever existed in
America.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It may be of interest for us to inquire as to
what was the real extent of this power, and the means employed by
the Mexicans to maintain this power; also how they had succeeded
in attaining the same. They were not by nature more gifted than
the surrounding tribes. The valley of Mexico is an upland basin.
It is oval in form, surrounded by ranges of mountains, rising one
above the other, with depressions between. The area of the valley
itself is about sixteen hundred square miles. The Mexicans were
the last one of the seven kindred tribes who styled themselves,
collectively, the Nahuatlacs. We treat of them as the Nahuas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Nahuas on the north and the Mayas on the
south included the civilized nations. When the Mexicans arrived
in this valley, they found the best situations already occupied
by other tribes of their own family. To escape persecution from
these, they fled into the marsh or swamp which then covered the
territory which they subsequently converted into their
stronghold. Here on a scanty expanse of dry soil, surrounded by
extensive marshes, they erected their pueblo. Being few in
numbers they were overlooked as insignificant, and thus they had
a chance to improve their surroundings. They increased the area
of dry land by digging ditches, and throwing the earth from the
same on the surrounding surface, and thus elevated it. In
reality, in the marshes that surrounded their pueblo was their
greatest source of strength. "They realized that while they might
sally with impunity, having a safe retreat behind them, an attack
upon their position was both difficult and dangerous for the
assailant." They were, therefore, strong enough for purposes of
defense. But they wished to open up communication with the tribes
living on the shore of the great marsh in the midst of which they
had their settlement. For this purpose they applied to their near
and powerful neighbors, the Tecpanics, for the use of one of the
springs on their territory, and for the privilege of trade and
barter in their market. This permission was given in
consideration that the Mexicans become the weaker allies of the
Tecpanics, that is, pay a moderate tribute and render military
assistance when called upon.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Pueblo of Mexico now rapidly increased in
power. Communication being opened with the mainland, it was
visited by delegates from other tribes, and especially by
traders. They fully perceived the advantages of their location
and improved the same. By the erection of causeways, they
entirely surrounded their pueblo with an artificial pond of large
extent. To allow for the free circulation of the water, sluices
were cut, interrupting these causeways at several places. Across
these openings wooden bridges were placed which could be easily
removed in times of danger.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus it was that they secured one of the
strongest defensive positions ever held by Indians. The Tecpanics
had been the leading power in the valley, but the Mexicans now
felt themselves strong enough to throw off the yoke of tribute to
which they were subject. In the war that ensued the power of the
Tecpanics was broken, and the Mexicans became at once one of the
leading powers of the valley. We must notice, however, that the
Mexicans did not gain any new territory, except the locality of
their spring. Neither did they interfere at all in the government
of the Tecpanics. They simply received tribute from them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Once started on their career of conquest, the
Mexicans, supported by allies, sought to extend their power. The
result was that soon they had subdued all of the Nahua tribes of
the valley except one, that was a tribe located at Tezcuco. This
does not imply that they had become masters of the territory of
the valley. When a modern nation or state conquers another, they
often add that province to their original domain, and extend over
it their code of laws. This is the nature of the conquests of
ancient Rome. The territory of the conquered province became part
of the Roman Empire. They became subject to the laws of Rome.
Public, works were built under the direction of the conquerors,
and they were governed from Rome or by governors appointed from
there.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Nothing of this kind is to be understood by a
conquest by the Mexicans, and it is necessary to understand this
point clearly. When they conquered a tribe, they neither acquired
nor claimed any right to or power over the territory of the
tribe. They did not concern themselves at all with the government
of the tribe. In that respect the tribe remained free and
independent. No garrisons of troops were stationed in their
territory to keep them in subjection; no governors were appointed
to rule over them. What the Mexicans wanted was tribute, and in
case of war they could call on them for troops. Secure in their
pueblo surrounded by water, they could sally out on the less
fortunate tribes who chose to pay tribute rather than to be
subject to such forays.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Instead of entering into a conflict with the
tribe at Tezcuco, the result of which might have been doubtful, a
military confederacy was formed, into which was admitted the
larger part of the old Tecpanic tribe that had their chief pueblo
at Tlacopan. The definite plan of this confederacy is unknown.
Each of the three tribes was perfectly independent in the
management of its own affairs. Each tribe could make war on its
own account if it wished, but in case it did not feel strong
enough alone, it could call on the others for assistance. When
the force of the confederacy went out to war, the command was
given to the war chief of the Mexicans, the "Chief-of-men."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If a member of the confederacy succeeded in
reducing by its own efforts a tribe to tribute, it had the full
benefit of such conquest. But when the entire confederacy had
been engaged in such conquest, the tribute was divided into five
parts, of which two went to Mexico, two to Tezcuco, and one to
Tlacopan. This co-partnership for the purpose of securing tribute
by the three most powerful tribes of the valley, under the
leadership of Mexico, was formed about the year 1426, just about
one hundred years from the date of the first appearance of the
Mexicans in the valley.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From this time to the date of the Spanish
conquest in 1520, the confederate tribes were almost constantly
at war with the surrounding Indians, and particularly with the
feeble village Indians southward from the valley of Mexico to the
Pacific, and thence eastward well towards Guatemala. They began
with those nearest in position, whom they overcame, through
superior numbers, and concentrated action, and subjected to
tribute. These forays were continued from time to time for the
avowed object of gathering spoil, imposing tribute and capturing
prisoners for sacrifice, until the principal tribes within the
area named, with some exceptions, were subdued and made
tributary.<a href="#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The territory of these tribes, thus subject to
tribute, constitutes what is generally known as the Mexican
Empire.<a href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a> But, manifestly, it is
an abuse of language to so designate this territory. No attempt
was made for the formation of a State which would include the
various groups of aborigines settled in the area tributary to the
confederacy. "No common or mutual tie connected these numerous
and diverse tribes," excepting hatred of the Mexican confederacy.
The tribes were left independent under their own chiefs. They
well knew the tribute must be forthcoming, or else they would
feel the weight of their conquerors' displeasure. But such a
domination of the strong over the weak, for no other reason than
to enforce an unwilling tribute, can never form a nation, or an
empire.<a href="#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a> These subject tribes,
held down by heavy burdens&mdash;inspired by enmity, ever ready
to revolt&mdash;gave no new strength to the confederacy: they
were rather an element of weakness. The Spaniards were not slow
to take advantage of this state of affairs. The tribes of Vera
Cruz, who could have imposed an almost impassable barrier to
their advance through that section, were ready to welcome them as
deliverers.<a href="#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a> The Tlascaltecans,
though never made tributary to the Mexicans, had to wage almost
unceasing war for fifty years preceding the coming of the
Spaniards. Without their assistance, Cortez would never have
passed into history as the conqueror of Mexico.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A word as to the real power of the Mexicans.
Their strength lay more in their defensive position than any
thing else. As we have just stated, the entire forces of the
confederacy were unable to subject the Tlascaltecans, the Tarasca
of Michhuacan were fully their equal in wealth and power. The
most disastrous defeat that ever befell the forces of the
confederacy was on the occasion of their attack upon this
last-named people in 1479. They fled from the battle-field in
consternation, and never cared to renew the attempt. As to the
actual population of the Pueblo of Mexico, the accounts are very
much at variance. Mr. Morgan, after taking account of their
barbarous condition of life&mdash;without flocks and herds, and
without field agriculture, but also considering the amount of
tribute received from other tribes&mdash;considers that an
estimate of two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants in the
entire valley would be an excessive number. Of these he would
assign thirty thousand to the Pueblo of Mexico.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is but an estimate. In this connection we
are informed, that, when the forces of the confederacy marched
against Michhuacan, as just stated, they counted their forces,
and found them to be twenty-four thousand men. This includes the
forces of the three confederate tribes, and their allies in the
valley, and would indicate a population below Mr. Morgan's
estimate. The Spanish writers have left statements as to the
population of Mexico which are, evidently, gross exaggerations.
The most moderate estimate is sixty thousand inhabitants; but the
majority of the writers increase this number to three hundred
thousand.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The main occupation of the Aztecs, then, was
to enforce the payment of tribute. From the limited expanse of
territory at the disposal of the Mexicans, and the unusually
large number of inhabitants for an aboriginal settlement, as well
as the natural inclination of the Mexicans, they were obliged to
draw their main supplies from tributary tribes. It is human for
the strong to compel the weak to serve them. The inhabitants of
North America were not behind in this respect.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> This is especially true of the
civilized tribes of Mexico and Central America. The confederacy
of the three most powerful tribes of Mexico was but a
copartnership for the avowed purpose of compelling tribute from
the surrounding tribes, and they were cruel and merciless in
exacting the same.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Our information in regard to this tribute is
derived almost entirely from a collection of picture writings,
known as the Mendoza collection, which will be described more
particularly when we describe their picture writings. The
confederacy was never at a loss for an excuse to pounce upon a
tribe and reduce them to tribute. Sometimes the tribe marked out
for a prey, knowing their case to be hopeless, submitted at once
when the demand was made; but, whether they yielded with or
without a struggle, the result was the same&mdash;that is, a
certain amount of tribute was imposed on them. This tribute
consisted of articles which the tribe either manufactured, or was
in situation to acquire by means of trade or war; but, in
addition to this, it also included the products of their limited
agriculture.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The same distribution of land obtained among
all the civilized tribes that we have already sketched among the
Mexicans. So, a portion of the territory of each conquered tribe
would be set aside to be cultivated for the use of the
confederacy. But, as the tribe did not have any land of its own,
except for some official purpose, this implies that each gens
would have to set aside a small part of its territory for such
purpose. Such lots Mr. Bandelier calls tribute lots. These were
worked by the gentes for the benefit of the Mexicans. It is to be
noticed right here, that the Mexicans did not claim to own or
control the land; this right remained in the gentes of the
conquered tribe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The miscellaneous articles demanded were
generally such that they bore some relation to the natural
resources of the pueblo. For instance: pueblos along the coast,
in the warm region of country, had to furnish cotton cloth, many
thousand bundles of fine feathers, sacks of cocoa, tiger-skins,
etc. In other, and favorable locations for such products, the
pueblos had to furnish such articles as sacks of lime, reeds for
building purposes, smaller reeds for the manufacture of
darts.</p>

<center><img alt="Tribute Sheet" src="images/Ch15_image/Tribute.jpg"
width="478" height="289"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These facts are ascertained in the Mendoza
collection. We are given there the pictorial symbol, or
coat-of-arms, of various pueblos; also, a pictorial
representation of the tribute they wore expected to pay. The
plate is a specimen of their tribute rolls. The pueblos paying it
are not, however, shown. Considerable can be learned from a study
of this collection &mdash;such, for instance, as that the Pueblo
of Chala had to pay a tribute of forty little bells, and eighty
copper ax blades.<a href="#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a> And, in
another place, we learn that the Pueblo of Yzamatitan was
tributary to eight thousand reams of paper. The articles are here
pictured forth; the number is indicated by the flags, feathers,
etc. The tribute of provisions consisted of such articles as
corn, beans, cocoa, red-pepper, honey, and salt&mdash;amounting
in all, according to this collection<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a> to about six hundred thousand bushels.
Still it will not do to place too great a reliance on picture
records. The number of tributary pueblos must have been
constantly changing. The quantity of articles intended for
clothing was certainly very great. A moderate quantity of gold
was also collected from a few pueblos, where this was
obtainable.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The collection of this tribute was one of the
most important branches of government among the Mexicans. The
vanquished stood in peril of their lives if they failed to keep
their part of the contract. In the first place, the Mexicans took
from each subject tribe hostages for the punctual payment of
tribute. These hostages were taken to the Pueblo of Mexico, and
held there as slaves; their lives were forfeited if the tribute
was refused.<a href="#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a> But special
officers were also assigned to the subject tribes, whose duty it
was to see that the tribute was properly gathered and transmitted
to Mexico. These stewards or tribute gatherers, are the officers
that the early writers mistook for governors. Their sole
business, however, had to do with the collection of the tribute,
and they did not interfere at all in the internal affairs of the
tribe.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Where the forces of the confederacy had
conquered a tribe, but one steward was required to tend to the
tribute, but each of the confederate tribes sent their
representative to such pueblos as had become their own prey, and
as sometimes occurred, one pueblo paid tribute to each of the
confederate tribes, it had to submit to the presence among them
of three separate stewards.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can easily enough see that it required men
of ability to fill this position. They were to hold their
residence in the midst of a tribe who were conquered, but held in
subjection only by fear. To these people they were the constant
reminder of defeat and disgrace. They were expected to watch them
closely and report to the home tribe suspicious movements or
utterances that might come to their notice. We need not wonder
that these stewards were the tokens of chiefs. It was a part of
their duty to superintend the removal of the tribute from the
place where gathered to the Pueblo of Mexico. The tribe paying
tribute were expected to deliver it at Mexico, but under the
supervision of the steward. Arrived at Mexico the tribute was
received, not by the so-called king, the Chief-of-men, but by the
Snake-woman, or an officer to whom this personage delegated his
authority. This officer was the chief steward, and made the final
division of the tribute. We are not informed as to details of
this division. A large part of it was reserved for the use of the
tribal government. It was upon this store that the Chief-of-men
could draw when supplies were needed for tribal hospitality or
for any special purpose. The stores required for the temple, its
priests and keepers were gathered from this source. The larger
division must have gone direct to the stewards of the gentes, who
would set some aside for their official uses, some for religion
or medicine, but the larger part would be divided among the
members of the gentes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In our review of the social system of the
Mexicans we have repeatedly seen how the organization of gentes
influenced and even controled all the departments of their social
and political system. One of the cardinal principles, we must
remember, is that all the members of a gens stand on an equal
footing. In keeping with this we have seen that all were trained
as warriors; yet the great principle of the division of labor was
at work. Some filled in their leisure during times of peace by
acting as traders; others became proficient in some branch of
work, such as feather work, or making gold and silver ornaments.
Yet under a gentile system of society, persons practising such
callings could never become very rich or proficient, simply
because, being members of different gentes, there could not be
that cooperation and united efforts among workmen in these
various trades and callings that is necessary to advance them to
the highest proficiency. It required the breaking up of the
gentes and substituting for that group a smaller one, our modern
family, as the unit of social organization, before great progress
could be made.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From what we have just said it follows that it
is not at all likely that there was any great extremes in the
condition of the people. No very wealthy or extremely poor
classes. This brings us to consider the condition of trade and
commerce among them. They had properly no such a thing as money,
so their commerce must have consisted of barter or trade and
exchange. Some authorities assert quite positively that they had
money, and mention as articles used for such purposes grains of
cacao, "T" shaped pieces of tin or copper, and quills of gold
dust.<a href="#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> But Mr. Bandelier has
shown that the word barter properly designates the transactions
where such articles passed. But this absence of money shows us at
once that the merchants of Mexico were simply traders who made
their living by gathering articles from a distance to exchange
for home commodities.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are given some very entertaining accounts
of the wealth and magnificence of the "merchant princes of
Mexico."<a href="#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> It needs but a
moment's consideration of the state of society to show how little
foundation there is for such accounts. Mr. Bancroft also tells us
that "throughout the Nahua dominions commerce was in the hands of
a distinct class, educated for their calling, and everywhere
honored by the people and by kings. In many regions the highest
nobles thought it not disgraceful to engage in commercial
pursuits."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Though we do not believe there is any
foundation for this statement, yet trading is an important
proceeding among sedentary tribes. "The native is carried over
vast distances, from which he returns with a store of knowledge,
which is made a part of his mythology and rites, while his
personal adventures become a part of the folk lore."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a> It was their principal way of learning
of the outside world. It was held in equally high esteem among
the Mexicans. Such an expedition was not in reality a private,
but a tribal undertaking. Its members not only carried into
distant countries articles of barter, but they also had to
observe the customs, manners, and resources of the people whom
they visited. Clothed with diplomatic attributes, they were often
less traders than spies. Thus they cautiously felt their way from
tribe to tribe, from Indian fair to Indian fair, exchanging their
stuff for articles not produced at home, all the while carefully
noting what might be important to their own tribe. It was a
highly dangerous mission; frequently they never returned, being
waylaid or treacherously butchered even while enjoying the
hospitality of a pueblo in which they had been bartering.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We may be sure the setting out of such an
expedition would be celebrated in a formal manner.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a> The safe return was also an important
and joyful event. The reception was almost equal to that afforded
to a victorious war-party. After going to the temple to adore the
idol, they were taken before the council to acquaint them with
whatever they had learned of importance on their trip. In
addition to this, their own gens would give them appropriate
receptions. From the nature of things but little profit remained
to the trader. They had no beasts of burden, and they must bring
back their goods by means of carriers; and the number of such men
were limited. Then their customs demanded that the most highly
prized articles should be offered up for religious purposes;
besides, the tribe and the gens each came in for a share. But the
honors given were almost as great as those won in war.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mexicans had regular markets. This, as we
have already stated, was on territory that belonged to the tribe;
not to any one gens alone. Hence the tribal officers were the
ones to maintain order. The chiefs of the four phratries were
charged with this duty. The market was open every day, but every
fifth was a larger market.<a href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> They
do not seem to have had weights, but counted or measured their
articles. In these markets, or fairs, which would be attended by
traders from other tribes, who, on such occasions, were the
guests of the Mexicans, and lodged in the official house, would
be found the various articles of native manufacture: cloth,
ornaments, elaborate featherwork, pottery, copper implements and
ornaments, and a great variety of articles not necessary to
enumerate.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now briefly consider their arts and
manufactures. Stone was the material principally used for their
weapons and implements. They were essentially in their Stone Age.
Their knives, razors, lancets, spear and arrowheads were simply
flakes of obsidian. These implements could be produced very
cheaply, but the edge was quickly spoiled. Axes of different
varieties of flint were made. They also used flint to carve the
sculptured stones which we have described in the preceding
chapter. They also had some way of working these big blocks of
stone used in building. But they were not unacquainted with
metals&mdash;the ornamental working of gold and silver had been
carried to quite a high pitch. Were we to believe all the
accounts given us of their skill in that direction, we would have
to acknowledge they were the most expert jewelers known. How they
cast or moulded their gold ornaments is unknown. They were also
acquainted with other metals, such as copper, tin, and lead. But
we can not learn for what purpose they used lead or tin, or where
they obtained it.<a href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Cortez, in one of his letters, speaks of the
use of small pieces of tin as money. But we have already seen
that the natives had not risen to the conception of money. They
certainly had copper tools, and bronze ones. It seems, however,
that their bronze was a natural production and not an artificial
one&mdash;that is to say, the ores of copper found in Mexico
contain more or less gold, silver, and tin. So, if melted, just
as nature left them, the result would be the production of
bronze.<a href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> They were then ignorant
of the knowledge of how to make bronze artificially. This shows
us that they had not attained to a true Bronze Age; and yet the
discovery could not have been long delayed. Sooner or later they
would have found out that tin and copper melted together would
produce the light copper that experience had taught them was the
most valuable.</p>

<img alt="Yucatan Axes" src="images/Ch15_image/Axes.jpg" width="224"
height="118" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The most important tool they made of copper
was the ax. The ax, in both Mexico and Yucatan, was made as
represented in this illustration. From their shape and mode of
hafting them, we see at once they are simply models of the stone
ax; and this recalls what we learned of the Bronze Age in Europe.
At first they contented themselves with copying the forms in
stone.</p>

<img alt="Carpenter's Axe" src="images/Ch15_image/CarpAx.jpg" width=

<center><img alt="Mexican Carpenter" src="images/Ch15_image/MexCarp.jpg"
width="129" height="162"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Nature, everywhere, conducts her children by
the same means to the same ends. This form of ax is a
representation of a carpenter's hatchet. The next cut is from the
Mendoza collection, and represents a carpenter at work. He holds
one of these hatchets in his hand, and is shaping a stick of
timber. The other cut represents a form of copper tool found in
Oaxaca, where they were once used in abundance. The supposition
is that this implement was used for agricultural
purposes&mdash;probably as a hoe. The pieces of T-shaped copper
said to have been used as money, are diminutive forms of this
same tool. The statement is sometimes made that they had a way of
hardening copper. "This," says Mr. Valentine, "is a hypothesis,
often noted and spoken of, but which ranges under the efforts
made for explaining what we have no positive means to verify or
to ascertain." The presence of metals necessarily implies some
skill in mining; but their ability to mine was certainly very
limited. Gold and silver were collected by washing the sands. We
do not know how copper was mined; the probabilities are that this
was done in a very superficial way. Whenever, by chance, they
discovered a vein of copper, they probably worked it to an easy
depth, and then abandoned it. M. Charney speaks of one such
locality, discovered in 1873. In this case they had made an
opening eleven feet long, five feet wide, and three feet deep. To
judge from appearances, they first heated the rock, and then
perhaps sprinkled it with water, and thus caused it to split
up.<a href="#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> This is about all we can
discover of their Metallic Age. It falls very far short of the
knowledge of metallurgy enjoyed by the Europeans of the Bronze
Age; and, with the exception of working gold and silver, it was
not greatly in advance of the powers of the North American
aborigines.<a href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> Certainly no trace
of mining has been discovered at all on the scale of the ancient
mines in Michigan.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A few words as to some of their other arts,
and we will pass on to other topics. In manufacturing native
pottery, they are spoken of as having great skill. The sedentary
Indians everywhere were well up in that sort of work.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a> They knew how to manufacture cotton
cloth, as well as cloth from other articles. We have stated that
paper furnished an important article of tribute. They made
several kinds of paper. One author states that they made paper
from the membrane of trees&mdash;from the substance that grows
beneath the upper bark.<a href="#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a> But
they also used for this purpose a plant, called the maguey plant.
This was a very valuable plant to the aborigines, since we are
told that the natives managed to extract nearly as great a
variety of useful articles from it as does an inhabitant of the
East Indies from his cocoa palm. Amongst other articles, they
made paper. For this paper, we are told, "the leaves were soaked,
putrefied, and the fibers washed, smoothed, and extended for the
manufacture of thin as well as thick paper."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">They used feathers for plumes, fans, and
trimmings for clothing. The articles the Spaniards are most
enthusiastic in praising is that variety of work known as feather
mosaic. They took very great pains with this sort of work. The
workman first took a piece of cloth, stretched it, and painted on
it, in brilliant colors, the object he wished to reproduce. Then,
with his bunch of feathers before him, he carefully took feather
after feather, arranging them according to size, color, and other
details, and glued each feather to the cloth. The Spanish writers
assert that sometimes a whole day was consumed in properly
choosing and adjusting one delicate feather, the artist patiently
experimenting until the hue and position of the feather, viewed
from different points, and under different lights, became
satisfactory to his eye.<a href="#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This disregard of time is a thoroughly Indian
trait of character. Years would be spent in the manufacture of a
choice weapon. The impression is given that these feather-workers
formed a craft, or order, and that they lived by themselves. But
this would be such an innovation on the workings of the gens that
there is probably no foundation for it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will now consider the subject of religion.
We can never judge of the real state of culture of a people by
their advance in the arts of government and of living alone.
Constituted as men are, they can not help evolving, in the course
of time, religious conceptions, and the result is that almost all
the races and tribes of men have some system of belief, or, at
any rate, some manner of accounting for the present condition of
affairs, and some theory as to a future state. It is true that
these theories and beliefs are often very foolish and childish,
still they are not on that account devoid of interest. From our
present standpoint, we can clearly see that the religions belief
of a people is a very good index of their culture. At first such
conceptions are necessarily rude, but as the people advanced in
culture, they become clearer.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Fearing that we will be misunderstood in the
last statement, we will state to whom it applies. The Christian
world hold that God revealed himself to his chosen people, and
that we draw from his Word what is permitted mortals to know of
his government and the future world. We make no question but that
this is true. But long before there was a Hebrew people there was
a Paleolithic race, who doubtless had some vague, shadowy, ill
defined idea of supernatural power, and sought, in some infantile
way, to appease the same. Afterwards, but long before the glories
of Solomon, a Neolithic people were living in Palestine, and the
same culture was wide-spread over the world. To this day a large
part of the world's inhabitants have never so much as heard of
the Christian religion. It is to such people that we especially
refer.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The religious beliefs of the Indians have not
been fully studied as yet; but, until that is done, it is
scarcely possible to understand and fully weigh what is said as
to the religious beliefs of the Mexicans. What we can discern of
the religion of the Nahua and Maya tribes shows us that it is not
at all probable they had reached a stage of development in which
they had any idea of One Supreme, Over-ruling Power. But our
scholars differ on that point, many contending that the Mexicans
distinctly affirmed the existence of such a God.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a> To form such conceptions implies a
power of reasoning on abstract topics that is vain to expect of a
people in their state of development. We think, therefore, that
the idea that they had such a belief, arises from a
misconception. Let us see if we can discover how that was.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Nearly all of the North American tribes had
some word to express supernatural power. The Iroquois used for
this purpose the words "oki" and "otkon."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>49</sup></a> The first meaning of these words is
"above." As used by these Indians, however, they expressed the
working of any unseen, mysterious, and, therefore, to them,
supernatural power. There was, however, no idea of personality or
of unity about it. Other Indian tribes had words to express the
same meaning. The English and French explorers translated these
words into their languages in various ways. The most common is
the rather absurd one of "medicine," which has passed into common
use. Thus, to mention one in very frequent use, we have the
expression "Medicine-men"&mdash;meaning their priests and
conjurers. The same custom prevailed among the higher class of
sedentary Indians of Mexico and Central America. The Aztecs used
the word "teotl" to express the name meaning; the Mayas, the word
"ku;" the Peruvians, "huaca." But the word used, in each case,
meant not so much a personal supreme-being as it did an
ill-defined sense of supernatural, mysterious power. This point
not being clearly understood, it was quite natural that the early
writers understood by these various expressions their name of the
First Cause.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the present state of our knowledge, it is
certainly very hard to give an intelligent statement of the
religious conceptions of the Maya and Nahua tribes. Among the
Nahuas, their conception of creative power was that of a
pair&mdash;a man and wife. These were not the active agents,
however&mdash;they engendered four sons, who were the creators.
This seems to be a widely extended form of tradition. Two
authors, writing about fifty years after the conquest, speak of
the four principal deities and statues. They had a great many
idols besides&mdash;but four were the principal ones.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It would be very satisfactory could we frame
some theory to account for this state of things. If we could only
be sure that each god was symbolic of some of the
elements&mdash;or, if we could only say that this was but another
instance of the use of the number "four"&mdash;and thus connect
them with the cardinal points, it would be very satisfactory to
many. The amount of study that has been bestowed on this question
is very great, and it is very far from being settled. Each of
these four was the principal, or guardian, deity of a particular
tribe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>50</sup></a> All of these appear in
native traditions as historical personages, as well as deities.
It is for this reason that Mr. Bandelier concludes that the "four
principal gods were deified men, whose lives and actions became
mixed up with the vague ideas of natural forces and phenomena."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As prominent a figure as any in Central
American Mythology is Quetzalcohuatl; and we can form a good idea
of the force of the preceding remarks by considering this case.
The name is a compound of two words, "quetzal-cohuatl"&mdash;and
is, says Mr. Bandelier, a fair specimen of an Indian personal
name. He tells us that the meaning is "bright," or "shining
snake." Others have translated it, "feathered serpent." We have
referred to the attempt to show that the tablet of the cross, at
Palenque, had reference to him. Those who think he was the
nature-god of the Nahuas find a great deal of significance in the
name.<a href="#Refer"><sup>52</sup></a> Mr. Bandelier, after
carefully considering all reference to him by the early writers,
shows that it is quite as likely that Quetzalcohuatl "was a man
of note, whose memory was afterward connected with dim
cosmological notions." It is plain that our idea of the culture
of the Mexicans will vary according as we consider the base of
this myth to be a man, or the forces in nature producing the
fertilizing summer rain.<a href="#Refer"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The worship of Quetzalcohuatl was very widely
extended; but it was mostly confined to the Nahua tribes. But
there are somewhat similar traditions among the Maya tribes; and
this is one of those few points which, like the similarity of
their calendar systems, seems to point to a close connection in
early times. The Quiches have a very similar myth. Briefly, it is
to the effect that four principal gods created the world. One of
these was named Gucumatz&mdash;meaning, also, shining, or
brilliant snake. Some think that this is the same personage as
Quetzalcohuatl, and from this fact show how true it is that the
operations of the forces of nature everywhere affect the minds of
men in a similar manner.<a href="#Refer"><sup>54</sup></a> Others
will not, however, go as far as this, and will only say there is
a similarity between the two characters. The tribes in Yucatan
also have a tradition of Cuculcan, whose name means the same as
the two already mentioned. The authority who refers to him speaks
of him only as a man. The Quiche legend, already referred to,
speaks of Gucumatz only as a god. The Nahua traditions of
Quetzalcohuatl, as we have seen, are confused accounts of a man
and a god.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The traditions having reference to the earthly
career of Quetzalcohuatl represent him as having considerable to
do with Tulla and Cholula. At Tulla he appears in the light of a
great medicine-man, or priest; at Cholula, as a sachem. Still
other traditions represent him as a great and successful warrior.
None of these characters are incompatible with the others, from
an Indian point of view. These traditions are so hopelessly
confused, that it is doubtful if any thing of historical value
can be gained from them. As a deity, he was worshiped as god of
the air or wind. Why he should be so considered is answered in
various ways. If, reasoning from his name, we choose to believe
he is a nature-god&mdash;as such standing for the thunder-storm,
clouds of summer&mdash;then, as the winds "sweep the path for the
rain-clouds," he would be considered their god. Also, following
out this line of thought, we can see how, as the god which brings
the fertilizing summer rain, he would be considered the god of
wealth, and the patron deity of traders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not lose sight of the fact that all
these traditions are most woefully mixed; that, since the
conquest, many ideas from other than native sources have been
engrafted on them; and, furthermore, that other explanations that
are worth considering can be presented. The horticultural tribe
located at Cholula had Quetzalcohuatl for their tutelar deity.
Their crops depend upon the timely descent of the rain. What more
natural than that they should regard such rains as sent by him?
This pueblo was also famous for its fairs. "By its geographical
position, its natural products, and the industry of its people,"
it became a great trading market. Near it was raised cochineal
dye, in large quantities. This was eagerly sought after by
traders from a distance. Cholula was also famous for its pottery.
The Tlaxcaltecos told Cortez that the inhabitants of Cholula were
a tribe of traders; what more natural, then, than that their
tutelar deity should become, in the eyes of foreign tribes, the
god of traders.<a href="#Refer"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Quetzalcohuatl was but one of the four
principal gods. The tutelar deity of the Mexicans was
Huitzilopochtli. His altars were almost daily wet with the blood
of sacrificed victims. No important war was undertaken, except
with many ceremonies he was duly honored. If time were so short
that proper care could not be bestowed on the ceremonies, then
there was a kind of deputy god that could be served in a hurried
manner that would suffice.<a href="#Refer"><sup>56</sup></a>
After a successful battle, the captives were conducted at once to
his temple, and made to prostrate themselves before his image. In
times of great public danger, the great drum in his temple was
beaten. The Spaniards, by dire experience, knew well the meaning
of that awful sound.</p>

<center><img alt="Huitzilopochtli." src="images/Ch15_image/Huitzi.jpg"
width="375" height="606"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The plate represents what was probably the
idol of Huitzilopochtli. "It was brought to light in grading the
Plaza Mayor in the City of Mexico in August, 1790. It was near
the place where the great Teocalli stood, and where the principal
monuments of Mexico were. They were thrown down at the time of
the conquest and buried from sight. It is an immense block of
bluish-gray porphyry, about ten feet high and six feet wide and
thick, sculptured on front, rear, top and bottom, into a most
complicated and horrible combination of animal, human, and ideal
forms."<a href="#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a> This idol is generally
stated to be that of the goddess of death. But Mr. Bandelier,
after carefully reviewing all the authorities, concludes that it
represents the well-known war-god of the Mexican tribe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To properly conduct the services in honor of
these various gods, required established rites and a priesthood.
What we call "Medicine men" wizards, and names of similar import
among the northern tribes, were more correctly priests. There was
no tribe of Indians so poor but what they had these priests. But
we would expect this office to increase more in power and
importance among the southern Indians. Among the Iroquois, we are
told each gens elected certain "keepers of the faith." These
included persons both male and female. Their principal duty was
to see that the feast days were properly celebrated. From what we
know of the gens we feel confident that they would be perfectly,
independent in religious matters as well as in other respects.
Consequently it is not probable that there was even in Mexico any
hereditary caste of priests.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">However set aside, or chosen, or elected, we
have every reason to believe that the organization of the
priesthood was systematic. The aspirant for the office had to
acquaint himself with the songs and prayers used in public
worship, the national traditions, their principles of astrology,
so as to tell the lucky and unlucky days. When admitted to the
priesthood, their rank was doubtless determined by meritorious
actions. Successes in war would contribute to this result as well
as sanctity, a priest who had captured several prisoners ranking
higher than one who had captured but one, and this last higher
than the unfortunate who had taken none.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>60</sup></a> We must not forget that war was the
duty of all among the Mexicans. The priests were not in all cases
exempt; part of their duties may have been to care for the
wounded. It is not likely that the priests of any one god ranked
any higher than the priests of others, or had any authority over
them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This body of priests of whom we have just
treated concerned themselves a great deal with the social life of
the Mexicans, and their power was doubtless great. Their duties
commenced with the birth of the child, and continued through
life. No important event of any kind was undertaken without duly
consulting the priests to see if the day selected was a lucky
one. The Nahuas were, like all Indians, very superstitious, so
there was plenty of work cut out for the priests. Into their
hands was committed the art of explaining dreams,
fortune-telling, astrology, and the explanation of omens and
signs. Such as the flight and songs of birds, the sudden
appearance of wild animals; in short, any unexpected or unusual
event, was deemed of sufficient importance to require in its
explanation priestly learning. In addition there was the regular
routine of feasts.<a href="#Refer"><sup>61</sup></a> We have seen
what a multitude of gods the Nahuas worshiped. Like all Indian
people, they were very fond of feasts and gatherings of that
character; therefore feast days in honor of some one of the
numerous deities were almost constantly in order, and every month
or two were feasts of unusual importance. The most acceptable
sacrifice to these gods, and without which no feast of any
importance was complete, was human life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This introduces us to the most cruel trait of
their character. It was not alone true of the Mexicans, but of
all the Nahua tribes and of the Mayas, though in a less degree.
On every occasion of the least importance victims were
sacrificed. Any unusual event was celebrated in a similar manner.
Before the departure of a warlike expedition, the favor of
Huitzilopochtli was sought by the sacrifice of human life; on the
return of the same, similar scenes were enacted. On all such
occasions the more victims the better. These victims were mostly
captives taken in war, and wars were often entered into for the
express purpose of procuring such victims. They were even made a
subject of tribute. Devout people sometimes offered themselves or
their children for the sacrifice. The number of victims, of
course, varied from year to year, but it is possible that it
counted up into the thousands every year.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What we are able to gather from the religious
beliefs of the civilized nations sustains the conclusions we have
already arrived at in reference to their culture. We can but
believe this had been greatly overrated. It is the religion of
barbarians, not of a cultivated and enlightened people the
historians would have us believe in. It is a religion in keeping
with the character of the people who had confederated together
for the purpose of compelling unwilling tribute from weaker
tribes. It is in keeping with what we would expect of a people
still in the Stone Age, who still practised communism in living,
and whose political and social organization was founded on the
gens as a unit.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It will not be out of place to devote some
space to a consideration of their advance in learning; and first
of all let us see about their system of counting or numeration.
This knowledge, as Mr. Gallatin remarks, must necessarily have
preceded any knowledge of astronomy, or any effort to compute
time. They must have known how to count the days of a year before
they knew how many days it contained. We all know how natural it
is for a child to count by means of his fingers. This was
undoubtedly the first method employed by primitive man. Proof of
this is found in the wide extended use of the decimal system.
Among the civilized nations, traces of this early custom are
still preserved in the meaning of the words used to express the
numbers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To express the numbers up to twenty, small
dots or circles were used&mdash;one for each unit. For the number
twenty they painted a little flag, for the number four hundred, a
feather; and for eight thousand, a purse or pouch. The following
table represents the method of enumeration employed by the
Mexicans. But it is necessary to remark they used different
terminations for different objects.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Mexican System of Numeration." src=
"images/Ch15_image/Numerate.jpg" width="418" height="645"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Substantially the same system of numeration
prevailed among all the Nahua tribes and the Mayas. It will be
seen from this table that the only numbers having simple names
are one, two, three, four, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, four
hundred, and eight thousand. The other names are compounds of
these simple names. It is also easy to understand their method of
pictorial representation. In reference to the flag, the feather,
and the purse, we must remark that, when these were divided into
four parts, only the colored parts were counted. The collective
number, used among them much as we use the word dozen, was always
twenty; but queerly enough their word for twenty varied according
to the object to be counted. The regular word given in the table
was "pohualli." In counting thin objects that could be arranged
one above the other, the word twenty was "pilli." Objects that
were round and plump and thus resembling a stone, were counted
with "tetl" for twenty, and other words for different objects.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The division of time or their calendar system,
is one that was thought to show great advance in astronomical
learning, but of late years it has been shown that this also was
overrated. This question of how to keep a record of time was a
difficult one for primitive man to solve; that is, when he began
to think about it at all. A long while must have elapsed, and
considerable advance in other respects been made before the
necessity of such a thing occurred to them. The increase and
decrease of the moon would form a natural starting point. It is
well known that this is about as far as the knowledge of the
Indians extended. The Maya word for month means also moon,
showing this was their earliest system of reckoning time.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Table of Days." src="images/Ch15_image/Days.jpg"
width="418" height="705"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The various Nahua and Maya tribes of Mexico
and Central America had reached about the same stage of
development. But their calendar system is so similar that it
affords a strong argument of the original unity of these
people.<a href="#Refer"><sup>65</sup></a> All of the civilized
tribes had months of twenty days each, and each of these days had
a separate name, which was the same for every month of the year.
This period of twenty days was properly their unit of time
reckoning. It is true they had smaller divisions,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>66</sup></a> but for all practical purposes, they
were ignored. As none of these tribes possessed the art of
writing, they had to represent these days by means of
hieroglyphics. The following table shows the Mexican and Maya
days, the meaning of each, and the pictorial sign by which they
were represented. We must notice that the Maya hieroglyphics look
more arbitrary, more conventional than the Mexican. This is
interesting, because some of our scholars now believe the Mayas
were the inventors of the calendar. Their hieroglyphics,
therefore, as being the older of the two, should appear more
conventional. In the Mexican hieroglyphics for the days, we can
still trace a resemblance to the natural objects they represent;
in the Maya hieroglyphics, this resemblance has disappeared.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not out of place to theorize as to the
facts already mentioned. The first thing that strikes us is that
they should have chosen twenty days for a unit of time. There
must have been some reason lying back of this selection. It would
have been more natural for them to have chosen a number of days
(say thirty) more nearly corresponding to the time from one new
moon to another. Whether we shall ever learn the reason for
choosing this number of days is doubtful; but Mr. Bandelier has
given us some thoughts on this subject, which, though he is
careful to state are not results, but mere suggestions, seem to
us to have some germs of truth, the more so as it is fully in
keeping with Indian customs.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He points out that many of the names for these
days mean the same as the names of the gens in the more northern
Indian tribes. Thus seven of the days have the same meaning as
the names of seven of the nine gens of the Moqui tribe in
Arizona. He, therefore, suggests that the names of these twenty
days are the names of the twenty gens of the aboriginal people
from whom have descended the various civilized tribes under
consideration. Indeed, this is expressly stated to be the method
of naming the days adopted by the Chiapanecs, one of the tribes
in question.<a href="#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As soon as the people commenced to take any
observation at all, they would perceive that it took just about
eighteen of these periods of twenty days to make a year. So the
next step appears to have been the division of the year into
eighteen months. These months received each a name, and were of
course designated by a hieroglyphic. The names of the Mexican
months seem to have been determined by some of the feasts
happening therein. There is great diversity among the early
writers both as to the names of these months, and the order in
which they occur, as well as by the hieroglyphics by which they
are represented.<a href="#Refer"><sup>68</sup></a> It does not
seem worth while to give their names and meaning. We give a plate
showing the name, order in which they occur, and hieroglyphic
symbol of the Maya months. In point of fact, the months were very
little used, as we shall soon see it was not necessary to name
the month to designate the day; but of that hereafter.</p>

<img alt="Maya Months." src="images/Ch15_image/Months.jpg" width="320"
height="298" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">But it would not take these people very long
to discover that they had not hit on the length of a year.
Eighteen months, of twenty days each, make only three hundred and
sixty days; so the next step would be to add on five days to
their former year. As these days do not make a month, they were
called the nameless days. They were considered as being
unlucky&mdash;no important undertaking could be commenced on one
of them. The child born therein was to be pitied. But we will see
that the expression, "nameless days" was hardly the case among
the Mayas, though it was among the Mexicans.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps this will be as good a place as any to
inquire whether they had exact knowledge of the length of the
year. As every one knows, the length of the year is three hundred
and sixty-five and one quarter days, or very nearly; and for this
reason we add an extra day to every fourth year. We would not
expect to find this knowledge among tribes no farther advanced
than we have found these to be. If, as our scholars suspect, the
Maya be the one from which the others were derived, they would be
apt to possess this knowledge, if known. Perez, however, could
find no trace of it among them.<a href="#Refer"><sup>69</sup></a>
Many authors have asserted that the Mexicans knew all about it.
Some say they added a day every four years; others, that they
waited fifty-two years, and then added thirteen days; and some,
even, give them credit for still closer knowledge, and say they
added twelve and one-half days every fifty-two years.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>70</sup></a> Prof. Valentine, who has made their
calendar system a special study, concludes that they knew nothing
at all about the matter.<a href="#Refer"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The beginning of the year is variously stated.
Among the Mexicans it seems that, while the authors differ very
much, all but one places it on some day between the second day of
February and the tenth of April. As their word for year means
"new green," it is probable they placed its commencement about
the time new grass appeared. The Mayas are said to have placed
the commencement of the year about the sixteenth of July. As this
happens to be just about the time that the sun is directly
overhead in Yucatan, it has been surmised that the natives took
astronomical observations, and tried to have their year commence
at that time. But it must be manifest that, if they did not
possess a knowledge of the true length of the year, and so make
allowance for the leap-year, in the course of a very few years
they would have to revise this date.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Refer once more to the Maya table of days.
Suppose the first day of the year to commence with the day Kan.
As there are twenty days in a month, we see that the second month
would also commence with Kan. In like manner, Kan would be the
first day of every month of that year. When the eighteen months
were past, there would still remain the five days to complete the
year. Now, although they were said to be nameless days, the Mayas
gave them names. The first day was Kan, the second day Chichan,
the third day Quimij, the fourth day Manik, the fifth day Lamat.
The regular order of days we see. They were now ready to commence
a new year.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The next day in the list is Muluc. This
becomes the first day of the first month of the new year. But,
being the first day of the first month, it was the first day of
every month of that year. At the end of the eighteen months of
that year, the five days would have to be named in their order
again, which would carry us down to Gix, the first day of the
first month of the third year. It would also be the first day of
every month of that year. Similarly we see that Cavac would be
the first day of every month of the fourth year. The fifth year
would commence again with Kan. So we see that four of these
twenty days became of more importance than the others. The years
were named after them. The year in which the month commenced with
Kan was also called Kan. The same way with the other days. So the
name of the year was either Kan, Muluc, Gix, or Cavac. These four
days were called "carriers of the year;" because they not only
gave the name to the year, but because the name of the year was
also the name of the first day of every month of that year.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The foregoing will help us to understand the
Mexican method. Let us refer now to the list of Mexican days. The
first day of the first month was Cipac. For the same reason as
above set forth, this would be the first day of every month of
the year. The five extra days either were not named at all, or at
any rate they were not counted off in the table of days. The
consequence was that Cipac was the first day of every month; for
we have just seen that it was the first day of every month of the
first year. At the end of the eighteen months the five nameless
days would come in; but, as they did not form part of a month,
were not named. The first day of the first month of the next year
would be named as if they had not occurred.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>72</sup></a> But, when they came to name the years,
we find they proceeded on exactly the same principle as the
Mayas. Thus four of the twenty days, occurring just five days
apart, were taken to name the years. These days were Tecpatl,
Calli, Tochtli, and Acatl.<a href="#Refer"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bandelier, who made the valuable
suggestion in regard to the origin of the names of the days, has
also suggested that, inasmuch as there are four of the days more
prominent than the others, they may signify four original gentes,
from which the others have come. It seem to us, however, when we
notice they are just five days apart, that the system pursued by
the Mayas in naming their years explains the whole matter.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Before we mention the longer periods of time
in use among them we must refer to another mode of reckoning
time, and trace the influence of this second method on the one
already named. The method already explained seems to have been a
perfectly natural one&mdash;the second method is founded on
superstition. A large part of the duties of the priests, we
remember, was to determine lucky and unlucky days, and in
soothsaying. For this purpose they made a peculiar division of
time, which we will now try and explain.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For some cause or other, thirteen was a number
continually recurring in their calendar. We can perceive no
reason why it should have been chosen. It has been suggested that
it was just about the time from the appearance of a new moon to
its full. Be that as it may, the number of days thirteen comes
very near to what we would call a week. Among the Mexicans, and
probably among the Mayas, these thirteen days were divided into
lucky, unlucky, and indifferent days, and were supposed to be
under the guidance of different gods. The priests had regularly
painted lists of them, with the deities which governed them.
These lists were used in fortune telling.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now inquire as to how they kept track
of the years. The Mayas named their next longer period of time an
ahau. There is some dispute as to what number of years it meant.
Most of the early writers decide that it was twenty years;<a
href="#Refer"><sup>74</sup></a> but Perez, whose work we have
already referred to, contends that it was twenty-four years. And
this conclusion seems to be confirmed by a careful study of some
of their old manuscripts.<a href="#Refer"><sup>75</sup></a>
Thirteen of these ahaus embraced their longest period of time,
known as an ahau-katun. It had a length of either two hundred and
sixty or three hundred and twelve years, according as we reckon
either twenty or twenty-four years to an ahau. It may be that the
length of an ahau varied among the different tribes of the
Mayas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mexicans also had this week of thirteen
days. Twenty of these weeks, or two hundred and sixty days,
formed that part of the year they called the moon-reckoning; the
remainder of the year was the sun-reckoning. Their longer period
of time was also based on this number. A period of thirteen years
they called a tlapilli; four of these constituted a cycle equal
to fifty-two years. The end of this cycle was anxiously awaited
by the Mexicans. They supposed the world was to come to an end on
one of these occasions. As the time drew near, the furniture was
broken, the household gods were thrown into the water, the houses
were cleaned, and finally, all the fires were extinguished. As
the last day of the cycle drew to a close, the priests formed a
procession, and set out for a mountain about six miles from
Mexico. There an altar was built. At midnight a captive, the
bravest and finest of their prisoners, was laid on it. A piece of
wood was laid on his breast, and on this fire was built by
twirling a stick. As soon as fire was produced, the prisoner was
killed as a sacrifice. The production of new fire was proof that
the gods had granted them a new period of fifty-two years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To understand how the years in this cycle were
arranged and numbered, we must refer once more to the Mayas, for
though they did not use the cycle themselves, yet they give us a
hint as to how it was obtained, and afford one more reason why we
should think the Mayas were the originators of this calendar
system. We give a table showing the arrangement of the days of
the year among the Mayas. We will take the year Kan&mdash;that
is, we remember, when Kan was the first day of every month. We
would naturally think they would describe a day by giving the
name of the day and the month&mdash;as, the day Kan, of the month
Xul, or the first day of the month Xul&mdash;but instead of so
doing, they made use of the period of thirteen days.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For instance, we see, by looking at the table,
that the day ten Kan can not be any other day during the year
than the day above mentioned; so that, for all purposes, it is
sufficient to give the day and its number in the week. We notice,
however, that the last five columns of figures for week days of
thirteen are just the same as the first five. But this did not
confuse any, for the last five columns of days belong to the
"sun-reckoning," the others to the moon-reckoning. And though the
number of the day in the week was the same, yet a different deity
ruled over them than in the corresponding days of the first five
columns. We can not affirm that we know this to be true of the
Mayas. Such, however, we know to be the case among the
Mexicans.<a href="#Refer"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Almanac." src="images/Ch15_image/Almanac.jpg" width=
"670" height="377"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now we notice in this almanac that the last
day of the year Kan, is number one of the week. As the count goes
right along, the first day of the next year, Muluc, must be
number two. If we would make an almanac for that year, we would
find the first day of the third year would be number three of the
week. If we were to continue this, we would find that the first
days of the years, would range from one to thirteen. This table
shows the number in the week of the first day of the first
fourteen years. The first day of the fourteenth year would be
number one of the week again, but this time one Muluc, and not
Kan. If we would continue our researches, we would quickly
discover that fifty-two years would go by before we would have a
year Kan in which the first day of the year would be number one
again.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We think the above explains the origin of the
Mexican cycle of fifty-two years. The Mayas either never had this
cycle, or had abandoned its use.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>77</sup></a> The Mexicans however, used this period
of time, and they numbered their years in it in such a way that
we can not explain it, unless we suppose they derived it in some
such a way as just set forth. We give a table showing the order
of the years in a cycle, and also notice that all that was needed
was the number and name of the year to show at once what year of
the cycle it was. The year seven Calli, for instance, could never
be any other year than the twentieth of the cycle.<a href=

height="97" align="LEFT"> <img alt="Year Date." src=
"images/Ch15_image/YearDate.jpg" width="90" height="108" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">To express the dates, they of course painted
the hieroglyphic of the day, and dots for the number of days.
This cut, for instance, expresses the day-date "seven Acatl."
They generally wrote the dots in sets of five. Seven was
sometimes expressed in the above manner. When they wished to
express a year-date, they made a little frame and painted in the
hieroglyphics of the year, and dots for the number. This date
here expressed is their thirteen Acatl, which, by the above
table, is seen to be the twenty-sixth year of the cycle.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have already dwelt too long on this part of
the subject. Glancing back over the ground, we see there is
nothing implying astronomical knowledge, more than we would
expect to find among a rude people. We find there are several
particulars of the Mexican system which we could not understand,
except by reference to the Maya system. It would bother us to
explain why they should choose the days Tochli, Acatl, Tecpatl,
and Calli, to be the names of their years, if we did not know how
the Mayas proceeded. We would be at a loss to explain why they
choose the number of fifty-two years for the cycle, and arranged
their years in it as they did, if we had not learned the secret
from the construction of the Mayas' almanac. From this
comparison, we should say the Mexican calendar was the simpler of
the two. As the Mayas had twenty days in the month, and, for
priestly use, weeks of thirteen days, so they took twenty years,
which, as they imagined, were supported by four other years, as a
pedestal for their next longer period, the ahau; and for
apparently no other reason than that they had weeks of thirteen
days, they took thirteen of these ahuas for their longest period
of time. They did not use the cycle of fifty-two years, but they
numbered their years in such a way that, in effect, they were
possessed of it. The Mexican did away with all but the cycle of
fifty-two years.</p>

<center><img alt="Calendar Stone." src="images/Ch15_image/CalStone.jpg"
width="440" height="455"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No account of the calendar system of the
Mexicans would be complete without reference to the so-called
calendar stone. The stone, the face of which is sculptured as
represented in this cut, was dug up from the square in front of
the cathedral of the City of Mexico, where it had been buried in
1557. When the temple was destroyed, this stone still remained
entire. Finally the authorities, fearing it attracted too much
attention from the natives, ordered it buried. It was brought to
light again in 1790, but its early history was completely
forgotten. The astronomer Gama pronounced it a calendar stone,
and his interpretation of the characters engraved on it have been
the foundation for the idea that the Mexicans had considerable
knowledge of astronomy.<a href="#Refer"><sup>79</sup></a> Prof.
Valentine and others have, however, shown that it was simply a
sacrificial stone, which the artist had decorated in a peculiar
manner. This stone is considered by some to be so important that
we will condense Prof. Valentine's description of it as being the
best at hand. Not all of out scholars accept it, however. The
central figure is the face of the sun-god. It is decorated in a
truly savage style. It has ear-rings, neck-chain, lip-pendant,
feathers, etc. The artist's design has been to surround this
central figure with all the symbols of time. We notice on each
side of the sun a small circle or oval with hieroglyphics
resembling claws. In Mexican traditions these represent two
ancient astrologers who were supposed to have invented the
calendar. According to Nahua traditions of the world, there had
been four ages of the world; at the end of each age, the world
was destroyed. Right above and below the ovals with the claws, we
see four squares containing hieroglyphics.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of these squares refers to one of the
destructions of the world. The upper right hand square contains
the head of a tiger. This represents the first destruction of the
world, which was by tigers. The four dots seen, in this square do
not refer to a date as they generally do; it is a sacred number,
and constantly reappears in all hieroglyphics referring to feasts
of the sun. To the left of this square, crowded between it and
the pointer, can be seen the hieroglyphic of the day Tecpatl. The
little dot is one, so this day one tecpatl probably refers to the
day in which the feast in reference to this destruction was
celebrated. The second age was terminated by a hurricane. The
upper left hand square containing the hieroglyphic for wind
refers to this destruction. Between this square and the pointer
is crowded in the hieroglyphic of one Calli, referring to the
feast in memory of this destruction. The third destruction of the
world was by rain, the lower left hand square containing the
hieroglyphic of rain. Below, not very distinctly, is the date of
this feast, one quiahuitl. The last destruction was by water,
represented by the lower right hand square. The date of this
feast as represented below is seven Ozomatl.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Passing out of this central zone we notice the
hieroglyphics for the days of the month arranged in a circle. The
A shaped ray from the head of the sun indicates where we are to
commence to read; and we notice they must be read from right to
left. Resting on this circle of day, we notice four great
pointers not unlike a large capital A. They are supposed to refer
to sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight. Next in order after the
days we notice a circle of little squares, each containing five
dots. Making allowance for the space covered by the legs of the
pointers just mentioned, there are found to be two hundred and
sixty of these days; they, therefore, refer to the days of the
moon reckoning. We notice four smaller pointers not quite so
elaborate as those already referred to, resting in this circle.
They probably refer to smaller divisions of the days. The next
circle contains a row of glyphs not unlike kernels of corn. One
hundred and five are represented on this circle; they refer to
the days of the sun reckoning.</p>

<img alt="Sign of Rain." src="images/Ch15_image/Rain.jpg" width="125"
height="69" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Resting on this circle of days are small
towers; they, like the smaller pointers, refer to divisions of
the day. Adjoining each of these little towers is a figure; this
cut represents one of them. We notice they form a circle
extending clear around the stone. The meaning of this circle is
gathered from other painted records. It represents a rain storm;
four drops are seen falling to the ground. The ground is
cultivated, as shown by the three ridges; a grain of corn is
represented lying on the ground. This band on the stone is in

<p align="JUSTIFY">There remains only to explain the outer row or
band. At the bottom is a rude representation of two heads with
helmets. The meaning of these figures is unknown. From each of
these figures extend in a semicircle a row of figures of this
shape, ending with pointers at the top, between which is a
year-date. Near the points on each side is what might be
described as four bundles tied together. Each of the small
figures just described is the representation of a cycle of
fifty-two years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The date on the top is the year date, Thirteen
Acatl. This is an easily determinable date. From Mexican
paintings, we know the conquest of Mexico occurred in the year
Three Calli. From this tracing their years back by the table
given earlier (Arrangement of Years in a Mexican Cycle), we would
find that the first Thirteen Acatl we meet was in the year 1479.
This is exactly the date when, according to tradition, the great
temple was finished, and this stone dedicated by bloody
sacrifices. If we count the number of signs for cycles, we find
that there are just twelve on each side, twenty-four in all. As
the artist could easily have made this number more or less, the
probabilities are that it means something. The most plausible
explanation is, that in the year 1479, they had traditions of
twenty-four cycles. But this number of cycles is equivalent to
twelve hundred and forty-eight years, which would carry us back
to about the year 231, A.D., which date we must bear in mind; not
that we think there is any scientific value to it, but for its
bearing on other matter at the close of the chapter.<a href=

<p align="JUSTIFY">We come now to consider the subject of their
picture writings. The germ of writing is found in the rude
attempts to assist the memory to recall past events. Some of the
northern Indian tribes resorted for this purpose to belts of
wampum. When a new sachem was to be invested with office among
the Iroquois, the historical wampum belts were produced; an old
man taking them in hand, and walking back and forth, proceeded to
"read" from them the principles of the confederacy. In this case,
particular events were connected with particular strings of
wampum.<a href="#Refer"><sup>82</sup></a> Pictorial
representation would be the next stage. At first the aim of the
artist would be to make his drawings as perfect as possible. A
desire to save labor would soon lead them to use only the lines
necessary to show what was meant. This seems to be about the
stage of picture writing, reached by some Indian tribes, who have
left here and there specimens carved on rocks.</p>

<center><img alt="Indian Picture Writing." src=
"images/Ch15_image/PicWrite.jpg" width="355" height="200"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut is a specimen of such writing from
the ca&ntilde;on of the San Juan in Arizona. Although quite
impossible to read it, there is no doubt but what it expressed a
meaning at the time it was engraved.</p>

<img alt="Chapultepec." src="images/Ch15_image/Chapul.jpg" width="70"
height="100" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">From this stage of development would naturally
arise symbolical paintings. Thus "footsteps" might signify the
idea of going. A comma-shaped figure, issuing from a person's
mouth, would stand for speech. The next step is what we might
call rebus-writing, where not the thing itself was meant but the
sound. Thus this cut represents Chapultepec&mdash;meaning
grasshopper-hill, or locust mount. It is evident, here, the
pictures of the objects represent the name. They, probably, did
not use this principle farther than to represent the proper names
of persons and things before the coming of the Spaniards.</p>

<img alt="Amen." src="images/Ch15_image/Amen.jpg" width="144" height=
"85" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some think that, in addition to the above, the
Mexicans used, to a very limited extent, a true phonetic
writing&mdash;one in which the figures refer not to the thought,
but to the sound of the thought.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>83</sup></a> Others are not ready to concede that
point. They could not have been further along than the threshold
of the discovery, at all events. The Spanish missionaries were
very desirous of teaching the Indians the Pater-noster, the
Ave-Maria, and the Credo. Either the Indians themselves, or the
priests (probably the latter), hit on the device of using painted
symbols for the words and syllables of the church prayers and
formulas. Thus in this manner was painted the word Amen. The
first sign is the conventional figure for water, in Mexican "atl,"
which stood for A. For the second syllable they put the picture
of a maguey plant, in Mexican "metl." The whole, then, was
"atl-metl," which was as near as they could express the word
amen. We must observe, that this was after the conquest.<a href=

<center><img alt="Historical Sheet." src=
"images/Ch15_image/Historical.jpg" width="418" height="515"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The plate opposite is one of the paintings of
the Mendoza collection. This collection, we must remember, was
made after the conquest, simply to gratify the curiosity of the
King of Spain. The matter treated of is the events connected with
time when Motecuma the fifth "chief-of-men" held office. Around
the edge we see the hieroglyphics of the years. We notice he was
chief-of-men from the year one calli to two tecpatl. About the
only thing recorded of him is the different pueblos he conquered.
In all he subdued thirty-three; but only eleven are shown in this
plate. The pueblos are indicated by a house toppling
over&mdash;flames issuing from under the roof. The other little
hieroglyphics are the names of the pueblos. The last one in the
second transverse line from the bottom is the hieroglyphic of
Chalco, which we thus learn was reduced to tribute under this
chief. All the events indicated in this cut took place before the
discovery of America.<a href="#Refer"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<img alt="Chilapi&mdash;Tribute." src="images/Ch15_image/Chilapi.jpg"
width="224" height="126" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">A second part of this codex has reference to
the tribute received from various tribes. In this cut the
left-hand figure is the hieroglyphic of the town of Chilapi, and
is an excellent representation of their rebus-writing we have
just referred to. It is a tub of water, on which floats a
red-pepper pod. The Mexican word for this last is chilli, for
water it is "atl.". The word "pa" means above. For the full word
we have "chilli-atl-pa." Contracted, it becomes chilapi. The
figure to the right is the tribute. The five flags denotes one
hundred. Below is represented a copper ax-blade&mdash;from which
we infer that the Pueblo of Chilapi had to furnish a tribute of
one hundred copper axes.</p>

<center><img alt="Child Training." src="images/Ch15_image/Training.jpg"
width="315" height="275"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A third part of this same collection refers to
the Mexican customs. In this cut we have represented the training
of a boy at the different ages of four, six, thirteen and
fourteen years of age. The little round marks number the years of
his age. The little elliptical-shaped figures show the number of
tortullas the child is allowed at a meal. The boy is trained to
carry and make various things, to row a boat, and to fish.</p>

<img alt="Migration Chart." src="images/Ch15_image/Migration.jpg" width=
"250" height="178" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The most interesting of Mexican
picture-writings is the record of their wanderings. This was
formerly supposed to represent their migrations from
Asia&mdash;but is now known to refer only to their wanderings in
the Valley of Mexico. De Lafield, in his "Antiquities of
America," gives a full representation of this picture-writing.
Bancroft's "Native Races," Vol. II, pp. 548-49, give a very good
reduced copy. We will not attempt to reproduce it all. This cut
represents the beginning of it. A man is seen crossing a stream
in a boat. The figure behind him may mean an island, on which are
represented some pueblos and human figures. On the opposite bank
of the stream, to which the footsteps lead, is the hieroglyphic
of Culhuacan, "the curved mountain." The year date of this
movement is "one tecpatl." The character within that of Culhuacan
is Huitzilopochtli, their national god. The flakes issuing from
his mouth signify that he is guiding them. The principal figures
about this map are the hieroglyphic names of various places where
they stopped, and the time spent at each place.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Mayas seem to have been further advanced
in the art of writing than their Nahua neighbors. Specimens of
their hieroglyphic writings have been given in the preceding
chapter. The hopes of our scholars were greatly raised when, in
1863, the announcement was made that there had been discovered,
in Madrid, a Maya alphabet, which, it was expected, would unlock
the mysterious tablets just mentioned.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The alphabet thus discovered is represented in
the next cut. It will be seen that some of the letters have a
number of different forms. This discovery was hailed as of the
greatest importance, and a number of scholars at once set about
to decipher the tablets. They were speedily undeceived. The
alphabet is, practically, of no help whatever. Prof. Valentine
even goes so far as to declare that this alphabet was not of
native origin.</p>

<center><img alt="Landa Alphabet." src="images/Ch15_image/LandaAlph.jpg"

<br>
 <img alt="Maya T." src="images/Ch15_image/MayaT.jpg" width="58" height=
"71" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">He thinks that Bishop Landa, who is the
authority for this alphabet, and who was Bishop of Yucatan from
1549 to 1579, being anxious to assist the natives in learning the
new faith, set about the manufacture of an alphabet for them.
This he did by having the natives paint some native object which
came the nearest to the sound of our alphabet. Thus, for
instance, this symbol there are excellent reasons for supposing
represents the sun, or the word "day." The Maya word for this is
<i>te.</i> We find that this is the symbol that Landa employs for
the letter T, only, in his drawing, the central dot has fallen
into the lower dashes. Nearly all the other letters can be traced
to a similar source.<a href="#Refer"><sup>86</sup></a> But the
professor's reasoning does not satisfy all. He is believed to be
right in a number of his identifications; but still the
characters might have been used in a phonetic way.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Maya Manuscript." src=
"images/Ch15_image/Manuscript.jpg" width="330" height="703"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt but that the Mayas had a
different system than that in use among the Nahua people. The
knowledge how to use it was, probably, confined to the priests;
and, furthermore, the system was, doubtless, a mixed one. A few
phonetic characters might have been used; but they also used
picture-writing. The plate above is a sample of the manuscripts
they left behind. It is in the nature of a religious almanac, and
refers to the feasts celebrated at the end of a year. The line of
characters on the left hand are the days characters Eb and Been.
In the lower division, a priest offers a headless fowl to the
idol on the left. In the middle division, the priest is burning
incense to drive away the evil-spirit. In the upper division, the
assistant, with the idol on his back, is on his march through the
village. As yet, we know but very little about the tables. We
know the hieroglyphics of days and of months.</p>

<center><img alt="Hieroglyphics&mdash;Tablet of the Cross." src=
"images/Ch15_image/Tablet.jpg" width="340" height="575"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Examining the tablets in the Temple of the
Cross, at Palenque, represented below, we notice a large glyph,
at the commencement of the tablet, something like a capital
letter. This, Mr. Valentine thinks, represents the censers which
stood in the temples before the idols, in which fire was
constantly kept.<a href="#Refer"><sup>88</sup></a> Running
through the tablets we notice glyphs, in front of which are
either little dots, or one or more bars with little dots in front
of them. These are day-dates. The dots count one&mdash;the little
upright bars, five. The probabilities are that this tablet is a
sort of list of feast-days in honor of the gods represented by
the central tablet.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we have made a considerable effort to
acquaint ourselves with the social organization and customs of
the various tribes, and have spent some time in learning the
details of their calendar system, and their advance in the art of
writing, it will not be out of place to inquire as to their
history&mdash;to determine, if possible, some of the dates to be
given for the arrival of the tribes, and some of the important
points of their prehistoric life. Whatever difficulties we have
experienced in acquiring a knowledge of their customs will be
greatly increased now. Their architecture, social organization,
and general enlightenment could be perceived by the conquering
Spaniards, and our information in regard to the same should have
been full and complete. We have seen, however, how meager it is.
The only light thrown on these disputed points is the result of
the labors of modern scholars. When we were made acquainted with
some of the first principles of Indian society, we could read
with profit the accounts of the early writers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But, when we come to ask for dates in their
history, we are almost entirely at sea. The traditions, in this
respect, are almost worthless. So, all that we shall attempt to
do, is to present some of the thoughts of our scholars as to the
probable connection of the civilized tribes with each other, and
what value is to be given to the few dates at our command. We
will begin, first, with the Maya tribes. This includes those
tribes that speak the Maya language, and its dialects. It was in
their territory that the most striking ruins were found. They
include the tribes of Yucatan, Guatemala, Chiapas, and Tobasco.
Then there comes a break; but they were also settled on both
banks of the River Panuco. Many theories have been advanced as to
the origin of the Mayas. As yet, the question is not solved.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Not a few have supposed them to be the same as
the Mound Builders of the United States. Dr. Brinton has pointed
out that the language of the Natchez Indians contains some words
of the Maya.<a href="#Refer"><sup>89</sup></a> A Mexican scholar,
Se&ntilde;or Orozco-y-Berra, thinks it probable that the Mayas
once occupied the Atlantic sea-board of the United States; that
they passed from the peninsula of Florida to Cuba, and thence to
the other Caribbean Islands, and so to Yucatan. He states that
the traditions of the Mayas uphold this view.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>90</sup></a> But others are not ready to admit it.
We have found a number of points of resemblance between the Mayas
and the Nahuas. Differences we would, of course, expect to find;
but still the points of resemblance are sufficiently strong to
indicate either that the tribes were once subject to the same
influence, from whence they derived their culture, or else that
they are descended from the same stock. We have reverted to the
worship of Quetzalcohuatl, and shown how the Quich&eacute;s,
under the name of Gucumatz, worshiped a similar deity. We have
also referred to the great similarity of the calendar system.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the limited space at our command, it is
not possible to refer to the traditions of the Maya tribes. We
will refer to but one manuscript bearing on this question; but
this is, probably, the most important one. This manuscript was
written by a native with the Spanish letter, but in the Maya
language. It was written not far from the time of the conquest of
Yucatan by the Spaniards, and the account is, doubtless, as full
a one, from the native stand-point, as can be given. The period
of time used by the author is Ahau, which we have seen is either
twenty, or twenty-four years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Carefully going over this manuscript, Prof.
Valentine arrives at the following conclusions: About the Year
137, A.D., the Mayas started from some place they called Tulla,
or Tullapan, on their migration. Where this place was we do not
know. The traditions of all the civilized nations refer to this
place as a starting-point. It was a "land of abundance." It may
be that this was but some fabled place, such as almost all
primitive people have traditions of.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>91</sup></a> About the year 231, A.D., they arrived
on the coast of Central America, and spread themselves over a
large part of it. This same manuscript speaks of the "discovery"
of Chichen-Itza, 522, A.D. The date of the founding of Uxmal is
given as about the year 1000, A.D. From 1000 to 1200, A.D., was
the golden era of the Mayas in Yucatan.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The tribes at Uxmal, Mayapan, and Chichen-Itza
formed a confederacy of which Mayapan seems to have been the
head. About the year 1200, inter-tribal war broke out. It seems
to have been caused by the arrival of Nahua tribes, who
established themselves in Mayapan. They were finally expelled,
but they left the Mayas in such a state of exhaustion that they
could not present a united front against the Spaniards. Such are
the conclusions of Prof. Valentine. He estimates the length of an
Ahau at twenty years, and it does seem that the author of the
manuscript used that number of years.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Of the other branch of the civilized tribes we
know but very little. The historical picture writings of the
Mendoza collection, a collection compiled, remember, after the
conquest, and, therefore, representing the traditions then
current among the Mexicans, takes us back to 1325, A.D., to the
first settlement in the Pueblo of Mexico. Sahagun, a Franciscan
monk, who went to Mexico as early as the year 1529, and remained
there until his death in 1590, wrote a very voluminous account of
the Mexicans, their customs and history, and as he was in Mexico
at the time when their traditions were still fresh in the minds
of the natives, his account is probably as good as any. He
obtained his information in a very credible manner. He gathered
together some old Indians, well acquainted with the traditional
history of their country. They are supposed to have "refreshed"
their memory by inspecting a number of picture writings, which
have since disappeared.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is manifest that this history is valuable,
just in proportion as the traditions are valuable. He makes one
statement that Prof. Valentine has dwelt upon with great ability.
He states that numberless years ago the first settlers came in
ships and landed at a northern port, which, from that cause, was
called Pauntla. This is supposed to be the Panuco River. After
they had settled here, a large part of them, including their
leaders and the priests, went off south; Sahagun says as far as
Guatemala. The party left behind organized themselves into an
independent body. They reconstructed from memory the calendar;
they increased and became powerful, until pushing over the
mountain, they built the pyramid of Cholula, and finally reached
the city of Teotihuacan, where they built a central sanctuary.
For some reason they abandoned their homes, all except the
Otomies, and wandered off across the plains, and high, cold,
desert places, that they might discover new lands.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No dates are mentioned for these occurrences,
and we are not aware that this tradition is mentioned by other
writers. We recall that from the mouth of the Panuco River
southward, we found evidence of considerable population in olden
times. We also recall that in this section are the ruined
pyramids of Tuzpan and Papantla. Prof. Valentine is inclined to
think that this date is referred to on the calendar stone; that
is, 231 A.D. Just twenty-four cycles elapsed from this time to
the date of the dedication of the calendar stone in 1479.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He also thinks that the Maya traditions refer
to this same occurrence. One more reference to this same
mysterious date is contained in the traditions of the Tezcucan
tribe. According to the traditions, the beginning of things were
in the year 245 A.D. According to this view, then, the ancestors
of both Nahua and Maya people appeared on the gulf coast about
231 A.D.; in the same place where a Maya-speaking tribe are found
to-day. From here those who developed the Maya culture went to
the south and south-west; those who developed the Nahua went to
the west and north-west.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We do not profess to be a judge as to the
value of this tradition. Our scholars will, probably, at no
distant day, come to more definite conclusions in the matter.
Prof. Short thinks the strangers who at this early time made
their appearance on the gulf shore were colonies of Mound
Builders from the Mississippi Valley.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>94</sup></a> We think it best to be very cautious
about coming to any such conclusions. We must not forget that
back of the twelfth century is nothing but vague traditions. Mr.
Bandelier tells us that "nothing positive can be gathered, except
that even during the earliest times Mexico was settled or overrun
by sedentary, as well as by nomadic tribes that both acknowledged
a common origin."<a href="#Refer"><sup>95</sup></a> The savage
tribes have the general name of Chichimecas, but by right this
term ought to be applied to the sedentary tribes as well;
however, the word Toltec stands for these sedentary tribes. We
have all read about the great Toltec Empire in Mexico. This is a
ridiculous use of words. There was no tribe or nation of people
of the name of Toltecs.<a href="#Refer"><sup>96</sup></a> All
these prehistoric aborigines were probably Chichimecas; but by
Toltecs we refer to the sedentary tribes, the skillful workers
among them. If we are to judge any thing of traditions, the
original home of these people were somewhere to the north of
Mexico.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There was doubtless the usual state of
inter-tribal warfare, but after a prolonged period the sedentary
tribes&mdash;the Toltecs&mdash;were exterminated or expelled.
Their successors were utter savages, coming from the north also.
We doubt very much whether any date can be given for this event,
but traditions assign it to about the year 1064. Prof. Valentine
thinks he finds a reference to it in the calendar of stone. If we
will notice, in the outer band near the top are four little
bundles, or knots, in all, eight. We are told that each of these
bundles refers to a cycle of fifty-two years, or in all four
hundred and sixteen years. The date of the inauguration of the
stone is 1479. If we subtract the number of years just mentioned,
we have the date 1063. Whether this is simply a coincidence, or
was really intended to refer to that event, we can not say.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Considerable speculations have been indulged
in as to where the Toltecs went when driven out of Mexico. Some
have supposed they went to Yucatan, and that to them we are to
look for the builders of the ruined cities. This is the view of a
very late explorer, M. Charney.<a href="#Refer"><sup>97</sup></a>
Some have supposed we yet see certain traces of their presence in
Guatemala, where they helped to build up a great Quexche
"monarchy."<a href="#Refer"><sup>98</sup></a> But we know very
little about it. It is not probable that more than a feeble
remnant of them escaped with their lives.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the same mysterious regions from where
had issued the aboriginal Chichimecas and Toltec people, there
subsequently came still other bands of sedentary Indians, who
finally came to settle around the lakes of Anahuac. These
settlers all spoke closely related dialects of the same language
as their predecessors, the Toltecs. Finally the Aztecs appeared
on the scene, coming from the same mysterious land of the "Seven
Caves." According to their historical picture-writings, they
founded the Pueblo of Mexico in 1325. It is somewhat singular
that no record of this event appears on the calendar stone. If
the artist was ingenious enough, as Prof. Valentine thinks he
was, to represent the dispersion of the Toltecs in the eleventh
century, he surely would have found some way to refer to such an
important event as the founding of their Pueblo. From this date
the Mexicans steadily rose in power, until they finally became
the leading power of the valley.<a href=

<li>In this table we have followed Mr. Gallatin. According to
Prof. Valentine, the order of the years is different. This,
however, is immaterial to an understanding of the system.</li>

<li>"Myths of the New World." The doctor now thinks his statement
just referred to, too strong. There is, indeed, a resemblance, as
he pointed out; but it is not strong enough to found any theories
on.</li>

<li>This historical manuscript represents the traditions of the
Maya people shortly after the conquest. It is very likely its
author had before him picture records of what he wrote. Such
records have since disappeared. The manuscript itself, the
interpretation of it, and Perez's remarks are found in Stephen's
"Yucatan," Vol. II, Appendix. The same in Bancroft's "Native
Races," Vol. V, p. 628. The fullest and most complete discussion
is by Prof. Valentine in Proceedings Am. Antiq. Soc., October,
1879, p. 80, <i>et seq.</i> Whether there is any thing worthy of
the name of history is doubtful.</li>

<li>This historical notice is a mere outline. Such, however, is
all we wished to give. Those who wish for more details can not do
better than to refer to Mr. Bancroft's fifth volume on the
"Native Races." We do not believe, however, that any thing
definite is known of the early periods of which some writers give
such glowing descriptions. When they talk about the doings of
monarchs, the rise and fall of dynasties, and royal governors, we
must remember the majority of the descriptive matter is mere
nonsense, consequently our faith in the dates given can not be
very great.</li>
