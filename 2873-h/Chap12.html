<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="The" src="images/Ch12_image/The.jpg" width=
"116" height="190" align="LEFT"> ATTEMPTS to explain the origin
of the numerous tribes found in possession of America at the time
of its discovery by Europeans have been many and various. There
are so many difficulties attending the solution of this problem
that even at this day no theory has received that full assent
from the scientific world deemed necessary for its establishment
as an ascertained fact. New interest has been thrown around this
question by the discoveries of late years. In our south-western
territories we have clearly established the former wide extension
of the village Indians, remnants of which are still to be found
in the inhabited pueblos; and, as we have seen, the wide expanse
of fertile soil, known as the Mississippi Valley, has undoubtedly
been the home of tribes who are generally supposed to have
attained a much higher stage of culture than that of the
Indians&mdash;at least, of such culture as we are accustomed to
ascribe, whether justly or not, to Indian tribes. It becomes an
interesting question, therefore, to determine what connection, if
any, existed between the Mound Builders and the Indian tribes on
the one hand, and the Pueblo tribes on the other.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As to the works of the Mound Builders, one
class of critical scholars think they see in them the memorials
of a vanished race, and point out many details of construction,
such as peculiarities in form, in size, and position, which they
think conclusively prove that the works in question could only
have been produced by races or tribes far more advanced in
culture than any Indians. This belief finds expression by a
well-known writer in the following words: "A broad chasm is to be
spanned before we can link the Mound Builders to the North
American Indians. They were essentially different in their form
of government, their habits, and their daily pursuits." This is
substantially the opinion of a great many writers on this
subject.<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But this conclusion has not been allowed to
pass unchallenged. We have on record the convictions of a few
careful investigators that there is no necessity for supposing
that only an extinct or vanished race could have built the mounds
and thrown up the embankments which we observe in the valley of
the Ohio and elsewhere; that there is nothing, in fact, either in
the construction of the mounds themselves or in the remains of
art found in them, which we may not with safety ascribe to the
ancestors of our present Indians.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a> It will be seen that we may, indeed, be
at a loss to know what conclusion to adopt; hence, as an aid to
us in this direction, it may be well to inquire into the
organization of Indian tribes and their customs and manners at
the time of their discovery.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not necessary to sketch their history,
as this has been done many times. Moreover, it is but a dreary
recital of the gradual encroachment of the Whites on the lands of
the Indians, the vain endeavors of the latter to repress them,
and a record of many cruel acts of savage warfare, burning
villages, midnight massacre, and scenes of terrible sufferings.
The uniform result was that the Indian tribes were steadily
driven away from their ancient homes, until we now find them but
a sorry remnant on scattered reservations or grouped together in
the Indian Territory. Their ancient institutions are nearly
broken down, and it is with difficulty that we can gain an
understanding of their early condition; and yet this seems to be
necessary before we are prepared to decide on the origin of the
mound-building people.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It seems necessary here to briefly describe
the two great plans or systems of government, under one or the
other of which mankind, as far as we know them, have always been
organized, though, theoretically, there must have been a time, in
the very infancy of the race, when there was either no government
or something different from either of them. At the present day,
in all civilized countries, government is founded upon territory
and upon property. A person is described as living in such a
township, county, and state.<a href="#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a>
This seems to be a very simple and natural division, but, like
every thing else, it is the result of growth&mdash;of a
development. It took nearly three centuries of civilization and a
succession of able men, each improving on what the other had
done, to fully develop this system among the Greeks.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a> This is the basis of the modern form of
government. Whenever it was organized, it marked the termination
of ancient government. The other plan of government is founded on
personal relations.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A person would be described as of such a gens,
phratry, and tribe. It is sufficient to state the words gens, and
phratry simply denote subdivisions of a tribe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> This is the ancient system of
government, and goes very far back in the history of the race. It
is that state of society which everywhere preceded history and
civilization. When we go back to the first beginning of history
in Europe, we find the Grecian, Roman, and Germanic tribes in the
act of substituting the modern system of government for the
tribal state, under which they had passed from savagism into and
through the various stages of barbarism, and entered the confines
of civilization. The Bible reveals to us the tribal state of the
Hebrews and the Canaanites.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Under the light of modern research, we can not
doubt but what this form of government was very ancient, and
substantially universal. It originated in the morning of time,
and so completely answered all the demands of primitive society
that it advanced man from savagism, through barbarism, and
sufficed to enable him to make a beginning in civilization. It
was so firmly established as one of the primitive institutions,
that when it was found insufficient to meet the demands of
advancing society, it taxed to the utmost the skill of the Aryan
tribes to devise a system to take its place.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This was the system of government throughout
North America when the Spaniards landed on its shores. This is
true, at least as far as our investigations have gone.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a> In several cases tribes speaking
dialects of the same stock-language had united in a confederacy;
as, for instance, the celebrated league of the Iroquois, and in
Mexico, the union of the three Aztec tribes. But confederacies
did not change the nature of tribal government. As there was but
one general form or plan of government in vogue amongst the
Aborigines of North America at the time of discovery, we ought
certainly to find common features in the culture of the Pueblo
Indians of the South-west, the Mound Builders of the Mississippi
Valley, and the various Indian tribes; and if the lines of
resemblance are sufficient to show a gradual progress from the
rude remains of savage tribes to the more finished works of the
Pueblos, and between these and the Mound Builders, then we may
consider this fact as one more reason for believing that they
constitute but one people in different stages of development.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The tribal state of society is always
associated with village life. It makes no difference where we
commence our investigations, we will soon be convinced that
village life is the form in which people organized in tribes
lived. This is true of the wild tribes in Africa, and of the hill
tribes of India to-day.<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a> The same
was true of the early Greeks.<a href="#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a>
There must be a reason for this. It is found in their peculiar
system of government. People divided into groups and clusters
would naturally be drawn together into villages. We would expect,
then, to find that the Indian tribes lived in villages. We are
accustomed to speak of them as wandering nomads. This is scarcely
correct; or rather, it is certainly wrong, if applied to the
tribes east of the Mississippi, when first encountered by the
whites. Some of them may have been in a state of migration, in
search of better homes, or homes more secure from the attacks of
too powerful enemies, as was the case with the Shawnees, and
wandering bands on hunting or warlike expeditions were common
enough. The Germanic, tribes that overthrew the Roman Empire, for
a similar reason, were in a migrating state. But it is none the
less certain that they established permanent villages wherever
they found suitable places.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Nearly all the tribes claimed separate
districts, in which they had permanent villages, often
stockaded.<a href="#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a> The site of Montreal
was a famous Indian village,<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a>
and other villages were found in Canada. The Iroquois tribes had
permanent villages, and resided in them the greater part of the
year.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> One visited in 1677 is
described as having one hundred and twenty houses, the ordinary
one being from fifty to sixty feet long, and furnishing shelter
to about twelve families. In one case, at least, the town was
surrounded by palisades.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1539 De Soto made his appearance on the
coast of Florida. Four years later a feeble remnant of this
expedition landed at Panuco, Mexico. His route has not been
accurately traced, but it is certain he travelled the Gulf States
and crossed the Mississippi. De Soto himself found a grave in the
waters of this river, but under new leaders the expedition pushed
on through Arkansas, and probably found its most western point on
the prairies of the West, where, disheartened, it turned back to
near where De Soto died, constructed some rude boats, and floated
down the Mississippi, and so to Mexico. We have two accounts
written by members of this expedition,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> and a third, written by Garcilasso de
La Vega from the statements of eye-witnesses and memoranda which
had fallen into his hands.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From these considerable can be learned of the
Southern Indians before they had been subjected to European
influences. One of the first things that arrests attention is the
description of the villages. They found, to be sure, some desert
tracts, but every few miles, as a rule, they found villages
containing from fifty to three hundred spacious and commodious
dwellings, well protected from enemies&mdash;sometimes surrounded
by a wall, sometimes also by a ditch filled with water. When west
of the Mississippi they found a tribe living in movable tents,
they deemed that fact worthy of special mention. But in the same
section they also found many villages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One hundred and forty years afterward the
French explorer, La Salle, made several voyages up and down the
Mississippi. He describes much the same state of things as do the
earlier writers. The tribes still dwelt in comfortable cabins,
sometimes constructed of bark, sometimes of mud,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a> often of large size, in one case forty
feet square, and having a dome-shaped roof. Nor was this village
life confined to the more advanced tribes. The Dakota tribes,
which include the Sioux and others, have been forced on the
plains by the advancing white population, but when first
discovered they were living in villages around the headwaters of
the Mississippi. Their houses were framed of poles and covered
with bark.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Lewis and Clark, in 1805, found the valley of
the Columbia River inhabited by tribes destitute of pottery, and
living mainly on fish, which were found in immense quantities in
the river. They describe them as living in large houses, one
sometimes forming a village by itself. They describe one house
capable of furnishing habitations for five hundred people. Other
authorities could be quoted, showing that the Algonquin Indians,
living in Eastern and Atlantic States, had permanent villages.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a> The idea then, that the Indians
are nothing but wandering savages, is seen to be wrong. It is
well to bear this in mind, because it is often asserted that the
Mound Builders must have been a people possessing fixed
habitations. While this is doubtless correct, we see that it is
also true of the Indians.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is another feature of Indian life which
we will mention here, because it shows us a common element in the
building of houses, seen alike in the pueblo structures of the
West and the long houses of the Iroquois. That is, the Indian
houses were always built to be inhabited by a number of families
in common. All nations in a tribal state possess property in
common. It is not allowed to pass out of the gens of the person
who possesses it, but at his death is supposed to be divided
among the members of his gens; in most cases, however, to those
nearest of kin within the gens.<a href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a>
This communism showed itself in the method of erecting
houses.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The long house of the Iroquois was divided
into apartments so as to shelter from one hundred to two hundred
Indians. A number of these houses gathered together composed a
village. These were quite creditable structures of Indian art,
being warm and comfortable, as well as roomy. Should we examine
the whole list of writers who have mentioned Indian villages, we
would find them all admitting that the houses were usually
occupied by a number of families, one in the Columbia Valley, as
we see, sheltering five hundred persons.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is no question but the pueblos were
built by people holding property in common. They were, of course,
erected by a more advanced people, who employed better materials
in construction, but it is quite plain that they were actuated by
the same instincts, and built their houses with the same design
in view as the less advanced Indian tribes in other sections of
the country. What we have described as the small houses in
Arizona in the preceding chapter, in most cases includes several
rooms, and we are told that in one section they "appear to have
been the abode of several families."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Long House of the Iroquois." src=
"images/Ch12_image/LongHouse.jpg" width="490" height="232"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the main points the Indians would have
to attend to in the construction of their villages was how to
defend them, and we can not do better than to examine this point.
A French writer represents the villages of Canada as defended by
double, and frequently triple, rows of palisades, interwoven with
branches of trees.<a href="#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a> Cartier, in
1535, found the village of Hochelaga (now Montreal) thus
defended. In 1637 the Pequot Indians were the terror of the New
England colonies, and Capt. Mason, who was sent to subject them,
found their principal villages, covering six acres, strongly
defended by palisades.</p>

<center><img alt="Stockaded Onondaga Village." src=
"images/Ch12_image/Village.jpg" width="405" height="383"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Iroquois tribes also adopted this method
of defense. In 1615 Champlain, with Indian allies, invaded the
territory of the Iroquois. He left a sketch of his attack on one
of their villages. This sketch we reproduce in this illustration,
which is a very important one, because it shows us a regularly
palisaded village among a tribe of Indians where the common
impression in reference to them is that they were a wandering
people with no fixed habitations. The sketch is worthy of careful
study. The buildings within are the long houses which we have
just described. They are located near together, three or four in
a group. The arrangement of the groups is in the form of a
square, inclosing a court in the center. This tendency to inclose
a court is a very common feature of Indian architecture. Such, as
we have seen, is the arrangement of the pueblos. Such was also
the arrangement of the communal buildings in Mexico, Central
America, and Peru. In this case the village covered about six
acres also. The defense was by means of palisades. There seem to
be two rows of them. They seem to have been well made, since
Champlain was unsuccessful in his attack. In earlier times these
fortified villages were numerous.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Pomeiock." src=
"images/Ch12_image/Pomeiock.jpg" width="240" height="292" align="RIGHT">
Further south, this method of inclosing a village was also in
use. In 1585 the English sent an expedition to the coast of North
Carolina. An artist attached to this expedition left some cuts,
one of which represents a village near Roanoke. It is surrounded,
as we see, by a row of palisades, and contains seventeen joint
tenement houses, besides the council house. The historians of De
Soto's expedition make frequent mention of walled and fortified
towns. "The village of Mavilla," from which comes our name
Mobile, says Biedman, "stood on a plain surrounded by strong
walls." Herrera, in his General History, states that the walls
were formed by piles, interwoven with other timber, and the
spaces packed with straw and earth so that it looked like a wall
smoothed with a trowel.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Speaking of the region west of the
Mississippi, Biedman says: "We journeyed two days, and reached a
village in the midst of a plain, surrounded by walls and a ditch
filled by water, which had been made by Indians." This town is
supposed to have been situated in the north-eastern part of
Arkansas, and it is interesting to note that recent investigators
find what are probably the remains of these walled towns, in the
shape of inclosures with ditches and mounds, in North-eastern
Arkansas and South-eastern Missouri.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> The tribes throughout the entire
extent of the Mississippi Valley were accustomed to palisade
their villages&mdash;at least, occasionally.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Mandan Village." src=
"images/Ch12_image/Mandan.jpg" width="252" height="208" align="LEFT"> On
the Missouri River we find some Indian tribes that have excited a
great deal of interest among arch&aelig;ologists. It has been
surmised that, if their history could be recovered, it would
clear up a great many difficult questions. They were accustomed
to fortify their village's with ditches, embankments, and
palisades. This gives us a cut of one of their villages. It is to
be observed that it has a great likeness to some of the
inclosures ascribed to the Mound Builders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This has been noted by many writers. Says
Brackenridge: "In my voyage up the Missouri I observed the ruins
of several villages which had been abandoned twenty or thirty
years, which in every respect resembled the vestiges on the Ohio
and Mississippi."<a href="#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a> Lewis and
Clark, in their travels, describe the sites of several of these
abandoned villages, the only remains of which were the walls
which had formerly inclosed the villages, then three or four feet
high. The opinion has been advanced that the inclosures of the
Mound Builders were formerly surmounted by palisades. Mr. Atwater
asserts that the round fort which was joined to a square
inclosure at Circleville showed distinctly evidence of having
supported a line of pickets or palisades.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Should it be accepted that the inclosures of
the Mound Builders represent village sites, and that they were
probably further protected by palisades, it would seem, after
what we have just observed of the customs of the Indians in
fortifying their villages, to be a simple and natural explanation
of these remains.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have already referred to the fact that
scholars draw a distinction between the more massive works found
in the Ohio Valley and the low, crumbling ruins occupying
defensive positions found in such abundance along Lake Erie and
in Western New York, asserting the former to be the works of the
Mound Builders proper, and the latter the remains of fortified
Indian villages. This may be true, but it seems to us that there
is such a common design running through all these remains that it
is more reasonable to infer that the more massive works were
constructed by people more advanced than those who built the less
pretentious works, but not necessarily of a dilterent race. We
can not do better than to quote the remarks of Mr. Brackenridge
in this connection: "We are often tempted by a fondness for the
marvelous to seek out remote and impossible causes for that which
may be explained by the most obvious."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But inclosures and defensive works are only a
small part of the Mound Builders' remains. We know that large
numbers of mounds are scattered over the country, and we recall
in this connection what was said as to the erection of mounds by
Indian tribes in a preceding essay. Somewhat at the risk of
repetition we will once more examine this question. It is
generally admitted that it was the custom of Indian tribes to
erect piles of stones to commemorate several events, such as a
treaty, or the settlement of a village, but more generally to
mark the grave of a chief, or some noted person, or of a person
whose death occurred under unusual circumstances.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a> These cairns are not confined to any
particular section of the country, being found in New England,
throughout the South, and generally in the Mississippi Valley.
From their wide dispersion, and from the fact that they do not
differ from the structures built by Indian tribes within a few
years past, it is not doubted but what they are the works of
Indians.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, if we could draw a dividing line, and say
that, while the Indians erected mounds of stone, the Mound
Builders built theirs of earth, it would be a strong argument in
favor of a difference of race. But this can not be done. When De
Soto landed in Florida, nearly three hundred and fifty years ago,
he had an opportunity of observing the customs of the Indians as
they were before the introduction of fire-arms, and before
contact with the Whites had wrought the great change in them it
was destined to. Therefore, what few notes his historians have
given us of the ways of life they observed amongst the southern
tribes are of great importance in this connection. At the very
spot where he landed (supposed to be Tampa Bay) they observed
that the house of the chief "stood near the shore, upon a very
high mound, made by hand for strength."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Garcilasso tells us "the town and the house of
the Cacique (chief) Ossachile are like those of the other
caciques in Florida. . . . The Indians try to place their
villages on elevated sites, but, inasmuch as in Florida there are
not many sites of this kind where they can conveniently build,
they erect elevations themselves, in the following manner: They
select the spot, and carry there a quantity of earth, which they
form into a kind of platform, two or three pikes in height, the
summit of which is large enough to give room for twelve, fifteen,
or twenty houses, to lodge the cacique and his attendants. At the
foot of this elevation they mark out a square place, according to
the size of the village, around which the leading men have their
houses. To ascend the elevation they have a straight passage-way
from bottom to top, fifteen or twenty feet wide. Here steps are
made by massive beams, and others are planted firmly in the
ground to serve as walls. On all other sides of the platform the
sides are cut steep."<a href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Biedman, the remaining historian, says of the
country in what is now (probably) Arkansas. "The caciques of this
country make a custom of raising, near their dwellings, very high
hills, on which they sometimes build their huts."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a> Twenty-five years later the French
sent an expedition to the east coast of Florida. The accounts of
this expedition are very meager, but they confirm what the other
writers have stated as to the erection of platform mounds with
graded ways.<a href="#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a> Le Moyne, the
artist of this expedition, has left us a cut of a mound erected
over a deceased chief. It was, however, but a small one.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">La Harpe, writing in 1720, says of tribes on
the lower Mississippi: "Their cabins . . . are dispersed over the
country upon mounds of earth made with their own hands." As to
the construction of these houses, we learn that their cabins were
"round and vaulted," being lathed with cane and plastered with
mud from bottom to top, within and without. In other cases they
were square, with the roof dome-shaped, the walls plastered with
mud to the height of twelve feet.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> It is interesting to observe how
closely what little we do know about Mound Builders' houses
coincides with the above.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Recent investigations by the Bureau of
Ethnology have brought to light vestiges of great numbers of
their buildings. These were mostly circular, but those of a
square or rectangular form were also observed. In Arkansas their
location was generally on low, flat mounds, but vestiges of some
were also noticed near the surface of large mounds. In Southern
Illinois, South-eastern Missouri, and Middle and Western
Tennessee the sites of thousands were observed, not in or on
mounds, but marked by little circular, saucer-shaped depressions,
from twenty to fifty feet in diameter, surrounded by a slight
earthen ring. We know the framework of these houses was poles,
for in several cases the charred remains of these poles were
found. We know they were plastered with a thick coating of mud,
for regular layers of lumps of this burnt plastering are found.
These lumps have often been mistaken for bricks, as in the
Selzertown mound. In several cases the plastering had been
stamped with an implement, probably made of split cane of large
size.<a href="#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On the lower Mississippi we meet with the
Natchez, a tribe that has excited a great deal of interest; but
at present we only want to note that they also constructed
mounds. They were nearly exterminated by the French in 1729. But
before this Du Pratz had lived among them, and left a description
of their customs. Their temple was about thirty feet square, and
was situated on a mound about eight feet high, which sloped
insensibly from its main front on the north, but was somewhat
steeper on the other sides. He also states that the cabin of the
chief, or great sun, as he was called, was placed upon a mound of
about the same height, though somewhat larger, being sixty feet
over the surface.<a href="#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a> A missionary
who labored among them, stated that when the chief died his mound
was deserted, and a new one built for the next chief.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Neither was this custom of erecting mounds
confined to the Southern Indians. Colden states of the Iroquois:
"They make a round hole in which the body is placed, then they
raise the earth in a round hill over it."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> It was the custom among a large number
of tribes to gather together the remains of all who had died
during several years and bury them all together, erecting a mound
over them.<a href="#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> Mr. Jefferson, in
his notes on Virginia, describes one of these mounds, and relates
this interesting fact in reference to it: "A party of Indians
passing about thirty years ago through the part of the country
where this barrow is, went through the woods directly to it,
without any instructions or inquiry; and having staid about it
some time, with expressions which were construed to be those of
sorrow, they returned to the high road, which they had left about
a half dozen miles to pay this visit, and pursued their
journey."<a href="#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Coming down to our own times, the Indians had
lost a great many of their ancient customs, yet, at times, this
old instinct of mound burial asserts itself. About the first of
the century Blackbird, a celebrated chief of the Omahas,
returning to his native home after a visit to Washington, died of
the small-pox. It was his dying request that his body be placed
on horseback, and the horse buried alive with him. Accordingly,
in the presence of all his nation, his body was placed on the
back of his favorite white horse, fully equipped as if for a long
journey, with all that was necessary for an Indian's happiness,
including the scalps of his enemies. Turfs were brought and
placed around the feet and legs, and up the sides of the
unsuspecting animal, and so gradually the horse and its rider
were buried from sight, thus forming a good-sized burial mound.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a> Another instance came under Mr.
Catlin's observation at the pipe stone quarry in Dakota. He
visited there about 1832 and saw a conical mound, ten feet high,
that had been erected over the body of a young man accidentally
killed there two years before.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Enough references have now been given to show
that the Indian tribes certainly did erect mounds, and that there
is every reason to suppose they were the authors of the temple
mounds of the South, or of some of them, at any rate. We have now
shown that, according to early writers, the Indians did live in
permanent villages, often stockaded, and knew very well how to
raise embankments and mounds. It would seem as if this removed
all necessity for supposing the existence of an extinct race to
explain the numerous remains, collectively known as Mound
Builders' works. Yet, as this is surely an important point, it
may be well to carry the investigations a little further.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Taking in account the great amount of labor
necessary to raise such structures as the mounds at Cahokia and
Grave Creek, and the complicated works at Newark, some writers
have asserted that the government of the Mound Builders was one
in which the central authority must have had absolute power over
the persons of the subjects, that they were in effect slaves;<a
href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> and as this was altogether
contrary to what is known amongst Indian tribes, they must have
been of a different race.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If the Indians in a tribal state are known to
have erected some mounds, and to have built temple-platforms and
walled towns in the south, then all they needed was sufficient
motive, religious or otherwise, to have built the most stupendous
works known. We think the ruined pueblos in the Chaco
Ca&ntilde;on represent as great an amount of work as many of
those of the Mound Builders. A calculation has been made, showing
that over thirty million pieces of stone were required in the
construction of one pueblo,<a href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a>
besides an abundance of timber. Each piece of stone had to be
dressed roughly to fit its place; the timbers had to be brought
from a considerable distance, cut and fitted to their places in
the wall, and then covered with other courses, besides other
details of construction, such as roof-making, plastering, and so
forth, and this is not the calculation of the largest pueblo
either.<a href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> Yet no one supposes
that the Indian tribes who erected these structures were under a
despotic form of government.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We think, however, that it might be freely
admitted that in all probability the government of the Mound
Builders was arbitrary, but so was the government of a great many
Indian tribes. Amongst the Natchez the chief was considered as
descended from the sun. Nor was this belief confined to the
Natchez, as the tribes of the Floridian Peninsula asserted the
same thing of their chiefs. Among all these latter tribes the
chief held absolute and unquestioned power over the persons,
property, and time of their subjects.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Amongst the Natchez the power of the Great Sun
(their title for chief) seems to have been very great. This
nation had a regularly organized system of priesthood, of which
the chief was also the head. On the death of the chief a number
of his subjects were put to death to keep him company. But we
must notice that the subjects considered it an honor to die with
the chief, and made application beforehand for the privilege.
Bearing these facts in mind, it does not seem improbable that in
more distant days, when the Natchez or some kindred tribe were in
the height of their power, the death of some great chief might
well be memorialized by the erection of a mound as grand in
proportion as that of Grave Creek.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In fact, the more we study the subject, the
more firmly we become convinced that there is no hard and fast
line separating the works of the Mound Builders from those of the
later Indians. We therefore think that we may safely assert that
the best authorities in the United States now consider that the
mound building tribes were Indians, in much the same state of
culture as the Indian tribes in the Gulf States at the time of
the discovery of America, and we shall not probably be far out of
the way if we assert, that when driven from the valley of the
Ohio by more warlike people they became absorbed by the southern
tribes, and, indeed the opinion is quite freely advanced that the
Natchez themselves were a remnant of the "Mysterious Mound
Builders."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If the Mound Building tribes were here at a
comparatively late date, we ought to expect to find some
traditions of their former existence. The statement is quite
often made that the Indians had no tradition as to the origin or
purpose of the mounds, and from this it is argued that the mounds
are of great antiquity. But, instead of finding no traditions, we
find nearly every tribe possessed of some, and often very full
and distinct.<a href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> It makes no
difference that a number of those traditions are childish, and
that traditions are a very unsatisfactory sort of proof at best.
Still, if we observe that the traditions, such as they are, are
corroborative of other proofs, it is well to examine into them
anyway.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Iroquois tribes have a tradition, that is
given in the writing of Cusick, a Tuscaroa Indian. It is
generally considered as a nonsensical production, but Mr. Hale
points out that, "whenever his statements can be submitted to the
tests of language, they are invariably confirmed."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a> Such, for instance, are the assertions
that they formerly inhabited the country around the St. Lawrence
River in Canada, and further, that the Mohawk was the oldest
tribe, from whence the others separated in time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The substance of the tradition supposed to
refer to the Mound Builders, is as follows: South of the great
lakes was the seat of a great empire. The emperor resided in a
golden city. The nations to the north of the great lakes formed a
confederacy, and seated a great council fire on the river St.
Lawrence. This confederacy appointed a high chief as ambassador,
who immediately departed to the south to visit the emperor at the
golden city. Afterwards, the emperor built many forts throughout
his dominions, and almost penetrated to Lake Erie. The people to
the north considered this an infringement on their territory, and
it resulted in a long war.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The people of the north were too skillful in
the use of bows and arrows, and could endure hardships which
proved fatal to a foreign people. At last, the northern people
gained the victory, and all the towns and forts were totally
destroyed and left in ruins.<a href="#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a> If
this tradition stood alone, it would not be deserving of much
attention, but we know the Iroquois tribes did originally live in
the valley of the St. Lawrence. We also feel sure the Mound
Builders were a powerful people, and lived in the Ohio Valley.
What is there unreasonable, therefore, in supposing that the
Iroquois came in contact with them, and that this tradition rests
on facts?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But this tradition is very similar to one
among the Delawares. This tribe spoke a different stock language
than the Iroquois, and belonged to the Algonquin division of the
Indian tribes. There were many wars between the Delawares and the
Iroquois, but finally the latter were acknowledged masters. It is
well to keep this in mind, because with this feeling between the
two tribes, they would not be apt to have similar traditions
unless there was a basis of fact.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Gallatin informs us that the original home
of the Algonquins was to the north of Lake Superior. The
tradition states that the Delawares (they called themselves the
Leni-lenape) were living in a cold, fir-tree
country&mdash;evidently the wooded regions north of Lake
Superior. Getting tired of this country, they set out towards the
East in search of a better place, and probably followed the lake
shore around until they finally came to a great river&mdash;that
is, the Detroit. The country beyond was inhabited by a numerous
and powerful people, called the Allegewi,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a> who dwelt in great fortified towns.
Here they found the Huron-Iroquois tribes. This was before the
Iroquois had separated from the Hurons.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some treachery on the part of the Allegewi was
made the occasion of war. The Leni-lenape and the Hurons united
their forces. This is perhaps the Confederacy of Cusic. A long
war resulted, but in the end the Allegewi were defeated, and, as
the tradition states, "all went southward."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a> We see no reason to doubt but what we
have here a traditional account of the overthrow of the Mound
Builders. The remnant that fled south found the country inhabited
by mound-building tribes, and doubtless became absorbed among
them. In confirmation of this view it may be said that the
languages of the tribes of the Gulf States, which belong to one
stock language,<a href="#Refer"><sup>49</sup></a> have all been
greatly influenced by words derived from a foreign source.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps a large body of them may have lived on
as a fully organized tribe. As we have already stated, the
opinion is quite freely advanced that this is the origin of the
Natchez.<a href="#Refer"><sup>51</sup></a> It seems advisable to
inquire more particularly into the customs and traditions of this
tribe. Du Pratz, who lived among them in 1718, and claims to have
enjoyed the confidence of their chiefs and principal men, has
left the most complete account of them; though Father Charlevoix,
a Jesuit priest, in his letters, also describes them fully.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A number of interesting statements in regard
to them, at once arrest attention. Most of the tribes in the
southern region of the United States spoke dialects of a common
stock language (Chata-muskoki), showing a derivation from a
common source. The Natchez spoke a different language.
Sun-worship seems to have been carried to a greater extent than
among any other tribes we are acquainted with. As late as 1730
they still had their temples, where the eternal fire was kept
burning, carefully watched; for they believed that should it
become extinguished, it would surely bring great trouble on the
tribe. Among the Natchez, if anywhere among Indian tribes, the
power of the chief was absolute, and there seems to have been
something like privileged classes amongst them. We have already
referred to them as Mound Builders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But most interesting is it to learn of their
former wide extension and ancient power. Du Pratz says,
"According to their traditions they were the most powerful nation
of all North America, and were looked upon by other nations as
their superiors, and on that account were respected by them. To
give an idea of their power, I shall only mention that formerly
they extended from the River Manchas, or Iberville, which is
about fifty leagues from the sea, to the River Wabash, which is
distant from the sea about four hundred and sixty leagues; and
that they had about eight hundred suns, or princes."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>52</sup></a> It is at least a reasonable
supposition that that the Natchez were a remnant of the Mound
Builders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">So far we have dwelt chiefly on the relations
between the Indians and the Mound Builders. Let us now see if we
can not detect some connection between the Pueblo tribes of the
south-west and the Mound Builders. All the tribes in the Gulf
States had traditions of a western and south-western origin. In
regard to the Creek Indians, this tradition is very distinct.
They relate, with many details, their journey from the west,
their fight with the Alabamas, etc.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>53</sup></a> In the Natchez tradition, as given by
Du Pratz, they are seen, not only to come from the same western
source, but distinctly preserve recollections of pueblo
houses.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The substance of their traditions is that they
came from a pleasant country and mild climate, "under the sun,"
and in the south-west, where the nation had lived for many ages,
and had spread over an extensive country of mountains, hills, and
plains, in which the houses were built of stone, and were several
stories high. They further relate how, owing to increase of
enemies, the great sun sent some one over to examine and report
on the country to be found to the east. The country being found
extremely pleasant, a large part of their nation removed thither;
and, after many generations, the great sun himself came also.
Speaking of the ancient inhabitants of the country they came
from, the tradition states that "they had a great number of large
and small villages, which were all built of stone, and in which
were houses large enough to lodge a whole tribe."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>54</sup></a> We would offer the same suggestion on
these traditions as on the others. They are of value only so far
as supported by other testimony. The great objection to them is
that the pueblo structures of the west are evidently of recent
origin. So these traditions would prove that the Natchez Indians
were quite recently connected with the Pueblo tribes, which is
not at all probable. We have some slight evidence that does not
rest on traditions. Mr. Holmes has given us a plan of an ancient
village he discovered on the La Platte River, San Juan Valley. It
will be seen by reference to the plate that the buildings were
separated from each other. The forms are chiefly rectangles and
circles, and one or two seem to have been elliptical. This
description certainly reminds us of the circles and squares so
common among the Mound Builders. But there is also a truncated
mound, fifty by eighty feet, and nine feet high. "Its flat top
and height give it more the appearance of one of the sacrificial
mounds of the Ohio Valley than any others observed in this part
of the West." Mounds are known to exist in Utah.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt=
"Ruins near the La Platte Valley of the San Juan." src=
"images/Ch12_image/Ruins.jpg" width="289" height="513" align="LEFT"> We
need not expect to trace a continuous line of ruins from the San
Juan Valley to that of the Ohio, granting the migration to have
taken place, because a migrating race would not be apt to erect
monuments until they reached the end of their line of migration.
Those who take this view of it say that it is not at all strange
that when these migrating tribes reached their new homes in the
Mississippi Valley they erected structures differing from those
they had formerly built, because all their surroundings would be
different, and in the prairie sections they would find neither
stone for building their pueblos nor clay suitable for adobe
construction. So they would do the next best thing, and build a
fortified village. This is the view of that eminent scholar, Mr.
Morgan. It must be borne in mind, however, that the fortified
villages of the southern Indians, including those of the
Mississippi Valley, corresponded more nearly with those of the
Atlantic shore, and more northern tribes, than with the pueblo
structures.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is another line of proof which we think
has been read the wrong way, or, at least, applied too strongly,
and made to do service in proving that the Mound Builders
migrated from the valley of the Ohio to Mexico, and there laid
the foundation of that wonderful civilization which is yet a
riddle to the antiquarian.<a href="#Refer"><sup>56</sup></a> This
is derived from a study of the skulls procured from various
sections of this country, Peru, and Mexico. It is sufficient to
state that anatomists have made a careful study of the skulls of
individuals of various nations, and instituted certain
comparisons between them, and discoveries of great importance
have been made by this means. Now, some of our best American
scholars have insisted that the skulls of the Mound Builders and
the ancient inhabitants of Mexico and the Inca Peruvians are so
similar that they must have belonged to the same race.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This type of skull, however, is
characteristic, not only of the Mound Builders, the ancient
Mexicans and the Peruvians, but of the Pueblos, and of such
tribes as the Natchez, Creeks, and Seminoles. We think, with all
due regard to the opinions of others, that in the present state
of our knowledge of craniology we are not authorized in drawing
very important conclusions therefrom. About all we are justified
in stating is that the sedentary or village Indians, whether
found in North or South America, have certain common
features.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is also hard to see any great resemblance
between the works of the Mound Builders and the Pueblo tribes.
The truncated mounds discovered by Mr. Holmes, we remember, were
also used as foundations for house structures along the Gila. In
this feature we, of course, see a resemblance to the platform
mounds of the Mississippi Valley. But we must be careful in
tracing connections on such a slim basis as this. We must
remember also what a difference there is in the pottery of the
two sections.<a href="#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a> If we were to
give an opinion, based on the present known facts, we should say
the separation between the people who afterwards developed as the
pueblo builders of the west and the Mound Builders of the
Mississippi Valley took place at an early date.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But let us not suppose that this conclusion
clears up all mysteries. A problem which has thus far defied the
efforts of some of our best thinkers is still before us, and that
is: "From whence came the Indians?" As we remarked at the
beginning of this chapter, no one theory has yet received
universal acceptance. In view of these facts, it is not best to
present any theories, but content ourselves with such statements
as seem reasonably well settled. On all hands it is agreed that
the Indians have been in America a long while, and whatever
advance they were able to make in the scale of civilization has
been achieved in this country.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This statement implies that they were in
undisturbed possession of this country long enough for some
tribes of them to reach the middle status of barbarism, which
means advancement sufficient to enable them to cultivate the
ground by irrigation, and to acquire a knowledge of the use of
stone and adobe brick in building.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>59</sup></a> More than half the battle of
civilization had then been won. Look at it as we will, this
demands an immense period of time for its accomplishment. In the
arts of subsistence, government, language, and development of
religious ideas the advancement they had been able to make from a
condition of savagism to that in which the Mound Builders
evidently lived, or the Aztecs in Mexico, represents a
progression far greater than from thence to civilization.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are, therefore, sure that the Indians have
inhabited this country for an extended period. We can prolong the
mental vision backwards until we discover them, a savage race,
gaining a precarious livelihood by fishing and the chase. In
America there was but one cereal, or grain, growing wild. That
was maize, or Indian corn. We can not tell in what portion of the
continent it was native, but, in whatever section it was, there,
probably, first commenced permanent village life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A settled residence, and being no longer
dependent on hunting for a livelihood, would advance the Indians
greatly in the scale of culture. So we can understand how in one
section would arise Indian tribes possessed of quite complicated
systems of government and religion and a knowledge of
agriculture. And from this as a center they would naturally
spread out to other sections. The conclusion to which we seem
driven is, that there is no necessity for supposing the Mound
Builders to be any thing more than village Indians, in much the
same state of development as the southern Indians at the time of
the discovery. The Indian race shows us tribes in various stages
of development, from the highly developed Pueblo Indians on the
one hand to the miserable Aborigines of California on the
other.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These various tribes may be classified as the
wild hunting tribes and the sedentary, partially civilized
tribes. To this last division belong the Mound Builders. We have
seen how the partially civilized tribes in the valley of the San
Juan were gradually driven south by the pressure of wild tribes.
We need not doubt but such was the case in the Mississippi
Valley. But we need not picture to ourselves any imposing
movement of tribes. In one location a mound-building tribe may
have been forced to abandon its territory, which would be
occupied by bands of hunting tribes. In other cases they would
cling more tenaciously to their territory. The bulk of them may
have been forced south; some in other directions, and, like the
Pimas on the River Gila, or the Junanos east of the Rio Grande,
have retrograded in culture.<a href="#Refer"><sup>60</sup></a>
Some bands may even have reached Mexico, and exerted an influence
on the culture of the tribes found there.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is only necessary to add a brief word as to
the antiquity of the Mound Builders' works, or rather as to the
time of abandonment. On this point there is a great diversity of
opinion, and it seems to us almost impossible to come to any
definite conclusion. The time of abandonment may vary greatly in
different sections of the country, and we have seen how apt
Indian tribes, even in the same section, are to abandon one
village site in order to form another a few miles away.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>62</sup></a> Fort Hill, in Ohio, that so strongly
impressed its first explorers with a sense of antiquity,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>63</sup></a> may have been abandoned long before
the Circleville works, where Mr. Atwater could still distinguish
vestiges of the palisades that once helped to defend it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have said about all that can be said in a
brief review of the prehistoric life in America north of Mexico.
We have seen how much there is still for our scholars to work up
before we can profess to as full and complete a knowledge as we
have of the prehistoric life in Europe. We are just on the
threshold of discoveries in regard to the Paleolithic Age in this
country. The southern boundary of the great ice sheet is now
known to us. Many scholars have pointed out to us the scattering
bits of evidence going to show that the ancestors of the present
Eskimos once inhabited the interior of this continent. Dr. Abbott
has found unmistakable evidence of the presence of such a people
in New Jersey. Our Indian tribes who came next, are not properly
prehistoric, though many questions relating to them belong to
that field.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have examined the works of the people known
as Mound Builders. They are indeed varied and full of interest,
but our conclusion leaves their origin involved in the still
deeper question of the origin of the Indian race. We are
satisfied that they were village Indians and not tribes of a
vanished people. We have also examined that section of country
wherein the greatest development of village Indian life north of
Mexico took place. It would be very satisfactory could we show
lines of migration from the valley of the San Juan, as a center,
to the Mississippi Valley on the one hand, and to Mexico and the
South on the other. We can find some lines of evidence, but not
enough to positively state such an important truth.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now leave this field of inquiry. We
trust such of our readers as have followed us in these pages will
have clearer ideas of the prehistoric life in North America. They
must however regard this knowledge as simply a foundation, a
starting-point, or as the shallows along the shore, while the
massive building, the long journey, or the great ocean, is still
before them. Our scholars are giving their time and attention to
these problems. They are learning what they can of the traditions
and myths of the tribes still existing. They are studying their
languages and plan of government. They are also making great
collections of the works of their hands. We will hope some day
for clear light on all these topics, which will either confirm
our present conclusions or show us wherein we must change them,
or, perhaps, reject them altogether.</p>

It is proper to remark that the phratries are not a necessary
member of the series. Several of the Indian tribes had only gens
and tribe. Mr. Schoolcraft uses the words totemic system to
express the same organization. Totem, the Ojibway dialect,
signifies the symbol or devise which they use to designate the
gens. Thus the figure of a bear would be the totem of the bear
gens. We must remember that the tribes of to-day have, in many
cases, lost their ancient organization. See Morgan's "Ancient

this statement requires to be taken with some allowance. Personal
liberty seems to have been the birthright of every Indian.
("Mounds of the Mississippi Valley," Carr, p. 24.) The council of
the tribe is the real governing body of all people in a tribal
state of society. ("Ancient Society," Morgan.) When the war-chief
united in his person priestly powers also, he at once became an
object of greater interest. This explains why the government of
the chiefs among all the Southern Indian tribes appears so much
more arbitrary than among the northern tribes. His real power was
probably much the same in both cases, but superstition had
surrounded his person with a great many formalities. The early
explorers, acquainted only with the arbitrary governments of
Europe, saw in all this despotic powers whereas there might not
have been much foundation for this belief.</li>

<li>Mr. Hale suggests that copper was the gold of the North
American Indians, and that the "golden city" simply means a city
or town where they knew how to work copper. It is well known that
the mound building tribes had such knowledge, at least they knew
how to work native copper.</li>

<li>This tradition was first made known by Heckwelder, a
missionary among the Delawares, in his "History of the Indian
Nations." It is repeated at much greater length, and with
additional particulars, in a paper read by Mr. E. G. Squier,
before the Historical Society of New York. Mr. Squier has simply
translated a genuine Indian record known as the Bark Record. The
two authorities here mentioned consider the Delawares as coming
from west of the Mississippi. Mr. Hale points out that it was
more likely the Upper St. Lawrence&mdash;that portion known as
the Detroit River&mdash;that was the "Great River" of the
traditions.</li>

<li>From this word comes Alleghany Mountains and River.</li>

<li>In this connection it is at least interesting to note that
several authors&mdash;Squier, MacLean, and others&mdash;have
contended, judging from the fortified hills and camps, that the
pressure of hostilities on the Mound Builders of the Ohio Valley
was from the north-east.</li>

<li>We are not at all certain but our scholars will shortly come
to the conclusion that the Cherokees or Shawnees are quite as
likely to be the descendants of the Allegewi as the Natchez.</li>

<li>It is scarcely necessary to caution the reader as to the
value of this statement of ancient greatness. The chroniclers of
De Soto's expedition had nothing to say about it.</li>

<li>Stone <i>metates,</i> or mills, have so far been found only
in Missouri, not far from the Missouri River. As this is such an
important implement among the Pueblo tribes, its presence in this
locality is significant. (Thomas.)</li>

<li>(56) As the proof seems to be conclusive that the Indians of
the south who were encountered by the Europeans first visiting
that section were the builders of the mounds of that region, it
brings these works down to a date subsequent to the entry of the
civilized tribes into Mexico. (Thomas.)</li>

<li>Some of the pottery from South-eastern Missouri and Arkansas
shows a strong resemblance to that of some Pueblo tribes.
