THIS volume the author has sought to lay before the reader a
description of life and times lying beyond the light of history.
This is indeed an extensive subject, and calls for some
explanation, both as to the general design of the work and what
steps have been taken to secure correct information.</P> <P align=justify>History is a word of varied import. In general, when we talk
about history, we mean those accounts of past events, times, and
circumstances of which we have written records. Not necessarily
meaning alphabetical writing, because hieroglyphic records have
furnished much true history. Hieroglyphic writing, which long
preceded alphabetical writing, is itself a comparatively recent
art. In no country do we find any records carrying us further
back than a few thousand years before the Christian era. We have
every reason to believe that the historical part of man's life
on the globe is but an insignificant part of the whole.
This historic period is not the same in all countries. It varies
from a few centuries in our own country to a few thousands of
years in Oriental lands. In no country is there a hard and fast
line separating the historic period from the prehistoric. In the
dim perspective of years the light gradually fades away, the
mist grows thicker and thicker before us, and we at last find
ourselves face to face with the unknown past.</P> <P align=justify>This extensive period of time is not, however, utterly lost to
us. We have simply to gather our information in some other way.
Enthusiastic explorers, digging beneath the ashes of Vesuvius,
have brought to light the remains of an entombed city. Of this
city we indeed have historic records, but even if all such
records had long since disappeared, we would gather much
information as to the nationality of the inhabitants, their
customs, and manners, by a simple inspection of the relics
themselves. Everywhere over the earth, entombed beneath the feet
of the living, or crumbling on the surface, are the few relics
of a past far antedating the relics of Pompeii. They are the
proofs positive that some people inhabited the land in far
away times.</P> <P align=justify>Our object is to gather together the conclusions of the
scientific world as to primitive man. We wish to see how far
back in the geological history of the globe we can find evidence
of man's existence, and we desire to learn his surroundings and
the manner of his life. There can be no more important field
than for us to thus learn of the past. To read the story of
primitive man, to walk with him the earth in ages long ago, with
him to wage war on the huge animals of a previous epoch, to
recede with him before the relentless march of the ice of the
Glacial Age, to watch his advance in culture, to investigate
whether there are any races of men now living which are the
direct descendants of this primeval man.</P> <P align=justify>
The author makes no claims to original investigations.
He trusts, however, it will not be considered impertinent for a
mere loiterer in the vestibule of the temple of science to
attempt to lay before others the results of the investigations
of our eminent scholars. He has endeavored faithfully to perform
this task. As far as possible technical language has been
avoided. This is because he has written not for the
distinctively scientific men, but rather for the farmer, the
mechanic, and the man of business. Constant references are made
to the authorities consulted. The reader his a right to know who
vouches for the statements made in the text.</P> <P align=justify>
The pleasantest part of an author's duty is to return thanks for
assistance. After the manuscript was prepared with what care
could be bestowed on it, it was determined to submit it to some
of our best American scholars for criticism. Accordingly, each
of the gentlemen named on the title page were requested to
review one or more chapters. As far as possible, each one was
asked to review that chapter or chapters for which, either by
reason of the position they held, or the interest they were
known to take in such subjects, they would by common assent be
acknowledged as eminently fitted to sit in judgment. In justice
to them, it should be stated that they were not expected to
concern themselves with the literary merits or demerits of the
manuscript, but to criticise the scientific statements made
therein. To each and all of these gentlemen the author would
acknowledge his deep obligations.</P> <P align=justify>
We are indebted to Rev. J. P. MacLean, the well-known
archaeologist, both for many valuable suggestions, and for the
use of wood-cuts on pages 60, 138 and 396. We are also under
obligation to Rev. S. D. Peet, editor of the <i>American
Antiquarian,</i> for cuts illustrative of the effigy mounds of
Wisconsin. The officials of the Smithsonian Institution, and the
Bureau of Ethnology have our thanks for many cuts, for which
credit is given them throughout the work.</P> <P align=justify>
Finally, the author wishes to say that it was the intention to
make this work the joint production of the author and his
partner, Mr. S. C. Ferguson, but before any progress was made it
was deemed advisable to change the programme. While the literary
work has all been performed by the author, the many details
necessarily connected with the publication of a book were
attended to by Mr. Ferguson.</P>
