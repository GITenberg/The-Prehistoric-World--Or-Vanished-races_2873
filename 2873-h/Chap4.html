"130" width="130" align="LEFT"> HAVE been delving, among the
sands of ancient river bottoms for a proof of man's existence in
far remote times. Slight and unsatisfactory as they may be to
some, they are the materials with which we reconstruct a wondrous
story of life and times removed from us by many a cycle of
years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Men have frequently resorted to the caverns of
the earth for protection. In places we find caves that served
this purpose during the Paleolithic Age. The men of the Drift,
however, do not appear to have used them, save as temporary
places of refuge, perhaps as a protection from bands of savage
enemies, or from unusually inclement weather. But yet most
surprising results have attended the exploration of caves in
England, France, and Belgium. We find in those gloomy places that
the men of the Drift were not the only tribes of men inhabiting
Europe during the Glacial Age. In fact, living at later date than
the Drift tribes, but still belonging to the Paleolithic Age,
were tribes of people who appear to have utilized caverns and
grottoes as places of permanent resort, and, judging from their
remains, they had made considerable advance in the arts of living
as compared with the tribes of the Drift.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But before pointing out the grounds upon which
these conclusions rest, it may be well to give a slight review of
the history of cave research. The dread and awe which kept people
away from caves during the Middle Ages preserved their contents
for later discoverers. In the seventeenth century, some
adventurous spirits began to search in them for what they called
Unicorn horns, which were deemed a most efficacious remedy for
various diseases. This search served the good purpose of bringing
to light various fossil bones of animals, and calling the
attention of scientific men to the same.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The cave of Gailenreuth, in Bavaria, was
explored by Dr. Goldfuss in 1810. He came to the conclusion that
the bones of bears and other extinct animals were proofs of the
former presence of the animals themselves. Dr. Buckland, a
celebrated English writer, visited the cave in 1816, and became
much interested in the work; so much so that when Kirkdale
Cavern, in England, was discovered in 1821, he at once repaired
to the spot and made a careful exploration. The results satisfied
him that hyenas and other extinct animals had once lived in
England. He followed up his explorations in a number of cases,
and published a work on this subject in 1822, which marks the
commencement of a new era in cave research.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1825 Kent's Cavern, near Torquay, was
discovered, and Rev. J. McEnry made partial explorations in it.
He discovered flint implements and perceived they might be a
proof of the presence of man with these extinct animals. Dr.
Buckland had not found these relics, or else had passed them by
as of no importance, for he refused to entertain the theory that
man and the extinct animals had been contemporaneous.
Explorations made in France in 1827-8 had furnished such strong
evidence on this point that it was deemed established by some
scholars, but being opposed to the prevailing belief, nothing
came of it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1829 Schmerling commenced his
investigations in the caves of the valley of the Meuse. For years
he continued his work under many difficulties. Sir Charles Lyell
tells us he was let down day after day to the opening of the
Engis Cave by a rope tied to a tree. Arriving there he crawled on
all fours through a narrow passage way to the enlarged chamber,
where, standing in mud and water, he superintended the
investigations. He examined over forty of those caves, and
published his results in 1833. He clearly showed that man must
have been living along with various animals now extinct in
Belgium. But, as before remarked, it was deemed sufficient answer
to this careful explorer to point out that his results were
opposed to the accepted chronology, and so they were passed by.
When the time at last came, and their true worth was recognized,
Schmerling himself had passed away.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have already seen what great results
followed the exploration of DePerthes in the river gravels. When
it had been clearly established that man and extinct animals hid
coexisted in Europe, the results of cave explorations were
eagerly recalled, and governments vied with royal societies and
private individuals in continuing the researches. The results are
that a rich store of facts has been gathered from those gloomy
resorts, illustrative of the later stages of Paleolithic art.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A word as to the formation of caves, grottoes,
caverns, and rock shelters. These vary greatly in size, some
being so small as to furnish protection to but few individuals;
others, especially caves, so large that whole tribes might have
found a place of resort within their chambers. They are found in
all limestone countries. The formation of caves is now recognized
as due to natural causes acting slowly through many years.
Limestone rock is very hard and durable, but chemistry teaches us
that water charged with carbonic acid gas will readily dissolve
it. Rain-water falling from the clouds is sure to come in contact
with masses of decaying vegetable matter, which we know is
constantly giving off quantities of this gas. Laden with this the
water sinks into the ground, and, if it comes in contact with
limestone, readily washes some of it away in solution. But beds
of limestone rock are noted for containing great fissures through
which subterranean waters penetrate far into the ground. We can
readily see how this percolating water would dissolve and wear
away the surface of the rocks along such a fissure, and in
process of time we would have the phenomenon of a stream of water
flowing under ground.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Owing to a great many causes&mdash;such, for
instance, as the meeting of another fissure&mdash;we would expect
that portions of this underground way would become enlarged to
spacious halls. In some such a way as this it is now understood
that all caves have originated.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Owing to many natural causes the river may,
after a while, cease to flow, leaving enlarged portions of its
channel behind as a succession of chambers in a cave. But water
would still come trickling in from the tops and sides, and be
continuously dripping to the floor, where it speedily evaporates.
When such is the case it leaves behind it the limestone it held
in solution. So, in process of time, if the deposition is
undisturbed, there will be formed over the floor of the cave a
more or less continuous layer of limestone matter known as
stalagmite. The same formations on the top and sides of the cave
are called stalactites. In places where the drip is continuous
the stalactite gradually assumes the shape of an immense icicle;
while the stalagmite on the floor of the cave, underneath the
drip, rises in a columnar mass to meet the descending stalactite.
A union of these is not uncommon, and, we have pillars and
columns presenting the strange, fantastic appearance on which
tourists delight to dwell in their notes of travel.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While these accumulations are in all cases
very slow, still we can not measure the time since it commenced
by the rate of present growth, because this rate varies greatly
at different times and places even in the same cave. And we must
also remark that this complete series of changes only occur in a
few localities, the majority of caves being insignificant in
size.<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From what has been said as to the formation of
caves, we would expect them to occur in river valleys, and this
is the case, though in some instances there have been such
immense changes in the surface level of the country that we can
now find no trace of rivers near them. This is exactly similar to
some gravel deposits, which, as we have seen, are occasionally
found where is now no running water. The most noted caverns,
however, are found high up on the banks of existing rivers. We
can not doubt that the rivers were the cause of the caves. But
having excavated their beds below the level of the then existing
caves, they ceased to flow in them, and left them to be occupied
by savage animals and the scarcely less savage men. But at times,
swollen by floods, the river would again assert its supremacy and
roll its waters through its old channels.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These floods would not only tear up and
rearrange whatever <i>d&eacute;bris</i> had already accumulated,
but would introduce quantities of sediment and animal remains. In
some such a manner as is here pointed out (though exactly how
geologists are not agreed) caves were invaded, after being long
occupied by men or animals, by floods of water. In many cases the
evidence would seem to indicate that after such a visitation by
water the cave and its water-rolled and water-arranged contents
were left to silence, visited by neither man nor beast. In such
instances stalagmitic coverings would gradually form over the
confused <i>d&eacute;bris,</i> and in some places acquire a
thickness of several feet. In some instances several such floors
are found one above the other, pointing to a prolonged period of
usage, and then a quiet stage, in which the drip of falling water
alone broke the silence, and nature sealed up another chapter of
cave biography beneath the layer of stalagmite.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the most important caves of England is
Kent's Cavern, before mentioned. This cave was carefully explored
under the direction of a committee appointed by the British
Association, and to show the care and thoroughness of the work we
need only state that this work occupied the greater portion of
sixteen years, and hence the results obtained may be regarded as,
in a general way, illustrative of the life of the cave dwellers.
"This cave is about a mile east of Torquay harbor, and is of a
sinuous character, running deeply into a hill of Devonian
limestone, about half a mile distant from the sea. In places it
expands into large chambers, to which various distinctive names
have been given."<a href="#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us see what general results have been
reached by this committee. The investigation disclosed several
different beds of stalagmite, cave earth, and breccia. The lowest
layer is a breccia.<a href="#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a> The matrix
is sand of a reddish color, containing many pieces of rock known
as red-grit and some pieces of quartz. This implies the presence
of running water, which at times washed in pieces of red-grit.
The surface features must have been quite different from the
present, since now this rock does not form any part of the hill
into which this cave opens.<a href="#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a>And
this change in drainage took place before this lowest layer was
completed, since not only bears, but men, commenced to visit the
cave. The presence of bears is shown by numerous bones, and that
of man by his implements.</p>

<img alt="Spear-head&mdash;Lower Breccia, Kent's Cavern." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Spearhead.jpg" height="398" width="208" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must notice that all the implements found
in the breccia are similar to those of the Drift, being rudely
formed and massive. No doubt these are the remains of Drift men,
who, for some cause or other, temporarily visited the cave,
perhaps contending with the cave bear for its possession. But a
time at length arrived when for some reason neither animals nor
man visited the cave. The slow accumulation of stalagmite went
forward until in some places it had obtained a thickness of
twelve feet. Freely admitting that we can not determine the
length of time demanded for this deposition, yet none can doubt
that it requires a very long time indeed. Says Mr. Geikie: "How
many centuries rolled past while that old pavement was slowly
accreting, no one can say; but that it represents a lapse of ages
compared to which the time embraced by all tradition and written
history is but as a few months, who that is competent to form an
opinion can doubt?" But after this long period of quiet, from
some source great torrents of water came rolling through the
cave. We know this to be so, because in places it broke up this
layer of stalagmite and washed it away, as well as large portions
of the breccia below, and after the floods had ceased,
occasionally inundations still threw down layers of mud and silt.
This accumulation is known as cave earth, and is the layer
containing the numerous remains of the Cave-men. Here the
explorers were not only struck with the large number of
implements, but at once noticed that they were of a higher form
and better made. Instead of the rude and massive implements of
the Drift tribes, we have more delicate forms chipped all around.
And we also meet with those that from their form may have been
used as the heads of spears or arrows. Flakes were also utilized
for various purposes. We also find implements, weapons, and
ornaments of bone&mdash;a step in advance of Drift culture. They
had "harpoons for spearing fish, eyed needles or bodkins for
stitching skins together, awls perhaps to facilitate the passage
of the slender needle through the tough, thick hides; pins for
fastening the skins they wore, and perforated badgers' teeth for
necklaces or bracelets."<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> Nothing
of this kind has yet been shown as belonging to the men of the
Drift.</p>

 src="images/Ch4_image/Flake_spearhead.jpg" height="267" width=
"328"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The bones of a large number of animals are
also found in the cave earth. The most abundant is the hyena, and
no doubt they dragged in a great many others; but the agency of
man is equally apparent, as the bones have often been split for
the extraction of marrow. Besides bones of the hyena, we have
also those of the lion, tiger, bear, and reindeer.<a href=

"images/Ch4_image/Harpoons.jpg" height="470" width="341"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With these animals man, from time to time,
disputed possession of the cave. At one place on the surface of
the cave earth is found what is known as the "black band." This
is nothing more or less than the fire-place of these old tribes.
Here we find fragments of partially consumed wood, bones showing
the action of fire&mdash;in short, every thing indicating a
prolonged occupancy by man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No one can doubt but that this deposit of cave
earth itself requires a prolonged time for its accumulation.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a> But this period, however
prolonged, at length comes to an end. From some cause, both
animals and man again abandoned the cave. Another vast cycle of
years rolls away&mdash;a time expressed in thousands of
years&mdash;during which nature again spread over the entombed
remains a layer of stalagmite, in some places equal in thickness
to the first formation. Above this layer we come to a bed of mold
containing remains of the later Stone Age, of the Bronze, and
even of the Iron Age. Below the first layer of
stalagmite&mdash;the completed biography of Paleolithic times;
above, the unfinished book of the present. Such are the eloquent
results obtained by the thorough exploration of one cave. The
results of all the other explorations, in a general way, confirm
these. Mr. Dawkins explored a group of caverns in Derbyshire,
England. These caverns and fissures are situated in what is known
as Cresswell Crags, the precipitous sides of a ravine through
which flows a stream of water dividing the counties of Derby and
Nottingham.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut represents the different strata in
Robin Hood cave. It will be seen that, at one place, the
stalactite has united with the stalagmite below. It is not
necessary to go into the details of this exploration. All the
relics of man found in <i>d, c,</i> and the lower portions of
<i>b,</i> are the rude and massive forms peculiar to the River
Drift tribes. But the relics found in the breccia <i>a,</i> and
the upper portion of the cave earth <i>b,</i> denote a sudden
advance in culture. The rude tools of the lower strata are
replaced by more highly finished ones of flint.</p>

<center><img alt="Robin Hood Cave." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Robin_Hood_Cave.jpg" height="400" width=
"266"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The most important discovery was that of a
small fragment of rib, with its polished surface ornamented with
the incised figure of a horse. The peculiar value of this
discovery is, that it serves to connect the Cave-men of England
with those of the continent who, as we shall afterward see,
excelled in artistic work of this kind.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In another cave of this series, in association
with similar flints, were found the following bone implements. We
can only conjecture the use of the notched bone. The pieces of
reindeer horn, terminating in a scoop, may have served as a spoon
to extract marrow.</p>

<center><img alt="Horse Incised on Piece of Rib." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Horse_incised.jpg" height="121" width="280"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not fail to notice that the more
highly finished relics of the Cave-men are found in strata
overlying those of the River Drift; and, in the case of Kent's
Cavern, these two sets of implements are separated by a layer of
stalagmite requiring a very prolonged time for its formation.
This would imply that the Cave-men came into England long after
the tribes of the River Drift; and, judging from the relics
themselves, they must have been a distinct people. We must recall
how completely the climate and animals in England varied during
the Glacial Age. We have also seen how closely connected the
River Drift tribes were with the animals of the warm temperate
regions. Coming at a later date, totally distinct from them in
culture are those Cave-men&mdash;perhaps they may prove to be
associated with the Arctic animals. But, before speculating on
this point, we must learn the results attending the exploration
of the caves of Belgium, France, and other countries on the
continent of Europe.</p>

<center><img alt="Bone Implements&mdash;Cresswell Crags." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Bone_implements.jpg" height="480" width=
"280"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the valley of the river Meuse (Belgium),
and its tributaries, have been found a number of caves and
rock-shelters. It was in the caves of the Meuse that Schmerling
made his explorations. When the real value of his work was
recognized, the Belgian government had a thorough exploration
made by M. Dupont, director of the Royal Museum in Brussels. This
gentleman scientifically examined forty-three of these resorts.
His opinions, therefore, are deserving of great weight; but,
unfortunately, they are not accepted by all. These caves vary
greatly in size&mdash;many being mere rock-shelters. From their
position, we are at once struck with the prolonged period of time
necessary to explain their formation. They are found at very
different heights along the river's bank. In one case two caves
are so situated that the river must have sunk its bed nearly two
hundred feet between the time of their formation.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">M. Dupont thinks the evidence very clearly
points to the presence of two distinct stages in cave
life&mdash;one of which he calls the Mammoth period, and the
other, which is more recent, the Reindeer. It is, however, known
that the mammoth lived all through the Reindeer epoch, if not to
later times; so the names bestowed on these periods do not seem
very appropriate. We can readily see, however, that, while the
names might be wrong, the two periods might be reality. In many
cases, the same cave contained remains of both stages, separated
by layers of cave earth, and it is noticed that, in such cases,
those of the Reindeer stage are invariably of a later date. In
general terms, M. Dupont finds that the implements of the Mammoth
period are of a rude make, consisting of a poor kind of flint,
and poorly finished. But, in beds of the Reindeer epoch, the
flint implements consist, principally, of well-shaped blades and
flakes&mdash;with numerous bodkins, or awls&mdash;javelins, or
arrow-heads &mdash;besides articles of bone and horn such as
harpoons, and teeth of various animals drilled as if suspended
for ornaments. Their workmanship indicates decidedly more skill
than that of the implements obtained from the lower levels. But
the most remarkable finds of the Reindeer epoch consist of
portions of reindeer horn, showing etchings or engravings which
have been traced by some sharp point, no doubt by a flint
implement. One small bit of horn has been cut or scraped so as to
present the rude outline of a human figure.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">So far the evidence seems to bear out the same
conclusions as do those of the British caves, though it also
shows that the men of the Drift inhabited caves quite
extensively. We must remember, however, that the greatest wealth
of cave relics belongs to the so-called Cave-men, but that savage
tribes have always resorted to caves as a place for occasional
habitation.<a href="#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is in France that we find the greatest
wealth of relics of Cave-men. Sir John Lubbock has left us a
description of the valley of the Vez&egrave;re, where these
caverns occur. The Vez&egrave;re is a small tributary of the
Dordogne. "The rivers of the Dordogne run in deep valleys cut
through calcareous strata: and while the sides of the valley in
chalk districts are generally sloping, in this case, owing
probably to the hardness of the rock, they are frequently
vertical. Small caves and grottoes frequently occur: besides
which, as the different strata possess unequal power of
resistance against atmospheric influence, the face of the rock
is, as it were, scooped out in many places, and thus 'rock-
shelters' are produced. In very ancient times these caves and
rock-shelters were inhabited by men, who have left behind them
abundant evidence of their presence.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">"But as civilization advanced, man, no longer
content with the natural but inconvenient abode thus offered to
him, excavated chambers for himself, and in places the whole face
of the rock is honey-combed with doors and windows, leading into
suits of rooms, often in tiers one over the other, so as to
suggest the idea of a French Petra. Down to a comparatively
recent period, as, for instance, in the troublous times of the
Middle Ages, many of these, no doubt, served as very efficient
fortifications, and even now some of them are in use as store-
houses, and for other purposes, as, for instance, at Brantome,
where there is an old chapel cut in solid rock.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">"Apart from the scientific interest, it was
impossible not to enjoy the beauty of the scene which passed
before our eyes, as we dropped down the Vez&egrave;re. As the
river visited sometimes one side of the valley, sometimes the
other, so we had at one moment rich meadow lands on each side, or
found ourselves close to the perpendicular and almost overhanging
cliff. Here and there we came upon some picturesque old castle,
and though the trees were not in full leaf, the rocks were, in
many places, green with box and ivy and evergreen oak, which
harmonized well with the rich yellow brown of the stone
itself."<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus it will be seen this valley has been a
favorite resort for people at widely different times, and amongst
others, the cave dwellers of the Paleolithic Age. As in the caves
of Belgium, some of them are at a considerable height above the
stream, while others are but little above the present flood line.
Mr. Dawkins refers us to the results of the exploration of a
French scientist in one of the grottoes of this section, which
seem to be exactly similar to the results obtained from the caves
of Cresswell Crags and Kent's Cavern. The implements obtained
from the two lower strata are rough choppers and rude flakes of
jasper and other simple forms. Above these beds was a stratum of
black earth, underneath a sheet of stalagmite. Here were found
implements of a far higher type: those of flints, consisting of
flakes, saws, and scrapers, with finely chipped heads and
arrow-heads, and awls and arrow-heads of bone and antler.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> Now these results can only be
interpreted as were those in the English caverns. The lower and
ruder implements belong to the men of the Drift; the later and
more polished ones to the Cave-men.</p>

<center><img alt="Bone Implements, Dordogne Caves." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Bone_implements_Dordogne.jpg" height="495" width=
"400"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Most of the relics obtained from these caverns
belong to the Cave-men proper. However, the implements from one
of them, known as Le Moustier, are of a rude type, and may belong
to those of the Drift. But most of them are of superior make and
finish. These specimens are all from caves in this vicinity.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that the men of the Drift were
very widely scattered over the earth. We find, however, that the
Cave-men had a much more limited range. Dr. Fraas has shown their
presence in Germany. At Schussenreid, in Bavaria, was found an
open air station of these people. It was evidently a camping-
ground, one of the few places where proofs of their presence have
been discovered outside of caves. Here we found the usual
<i>d&eacute;bris,</i> consisting of broken bones, charcoal,
blackened hearth-stone, and implements of flint and horn. We must
stop a minute to notice a bit of unexpected proof as to the
severity of climate then prevailing in Europe. This deposit was
covered up with sand, and on this sand were the remains of moss,
sufficiently perfect to determine the kind. We are assured that
it is composed of species now found only in Alpine regions, near
or above the snow-line, and in such northern countries as
Greenland and Spitzbergen.<a href="#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a> Dr.
Fraas also proved their presence in several caves in Suabia. One
known as the Hohlefels Cave was very rich in these relics. They
have been found in Switzerland, as at Thayengen; but are not
found south of the Alps or the Pyrenees. Men, indeed, inhabited
caves in Italy, but they did not use the implements
characteristic of the Cave-men.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a>
Mr. Dawkins points out that this range corresponds very nearly to
that of the northern group of animals, thus differing widely from
the men of the River Drift. In this connection we must notice
that the reindeer is the animal whose remains are most commonly
met with in the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> they have left in the caves.
This animal surely testifies to a cold climate. We are thus
justified in concluding that the Cave-men are associated with the
Arctic group of animals.<a href="#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now turn our attention to the culture
of the Cave-men. We must reflect that long ages, with great
changes of climate and life, both animal and vegetable, have
rolled away since the remains of these early races were sealed by
the stalagmite formation in caves. The relics at their best are
but scanty memorials of a people long since passed, and we can
not expect, can not hope, to recover more than a general outline.
But this will be found full of interest, for it is a picture of
Paleolithic life and times existing in Europe long ages before
the pyramids of Egypt were uplifted.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With respect to habitations, we have already
seen that he took up his abode in caves, at least where they were
suitable. According to their depth and the light penetrating
them, he either occupied the whole extent of them, or established
himself in the outlet only. About the center of the cave some
slabs of stone, selected from the hardest rock such as sandstone
or slate, were bedded down in the ground, and formed the hearth
for cooking his food. But in no country are such resorts
sufficiently numerous to shelter a large population; besides,
they, are generally at some distance from the fertile plains,
where game would be most abundant. In such cases they doubtless
constructed rude huts of boughs, skins, or other materials. Such
an out-door settlement was the station at Solutr&eacute;, France,
where has been found an immense number of bones of horses,
reindeers, also, though in less abundance, those of elephants,
aurochs, and great lions.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Rock Shelter at Bruniquel." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Rock_shelter.jpg" height="656" width="415"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Where no cave presented itself, these people
made for themselves convenient sheltering places under the cover
of some great overhanging rock. In various places in France such
resorts have been discovered. The name of "rock shelters" has
been given to such resorts. In such places, where we may suppose
they built rude huts, are found rich deposits of the bones of
mammals, birds, and fishes, as well implements of bone and
horn.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have frequently referred to the presence of
hearths, showing that they used fire. Like other rude races, it
is probable that they obtained fire by the friction of one piece
of wood upon another. M. Dupont found in one of the Belgium caves
a piece of iron pyrites, from which, with a flint, sparks could
be struck.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Speculations have been indulged as to the
probable condition of man before he obtained a knowledge of fire.
If the acquisition of fire be regarded as one of the results of
human endeavor, it must surely be classed as one of the most
valuable discoveries which mankind has made. We do not believe,
however, that we shall ever discover relics of races or tribes of
men so low in the scale as to be ignorant of the use of fire.
Even some of the flints which M. Bourgeois would refer to the
Miocene Age show evidence of its action.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The men of the Caves supported life by
hunting. But a very small part of their food supplies could have
been drawn from the vegetable kingdom. When the climate was so
severe that Alpine mosses grew at Schussenreid, acorns and like
nuts would be about all they could procure from that source. The
animals hunted by the Cave-men were principally reindeer, horses,
bisons, and, occasionally mammoths and woolly rhinoceros. But
they were not very choice in this matter, as they readily
accepted as food any animal they could obtain by force or
cunning. Wolves and foxes were not rejected, and in one cave
large numbers of the bones of the common water rat were obtained.
We know what animals were used as food, because we find their
bones split for the purpose of procuring the marrow they
contained. This was evidently to them a nutritious article of
diet, since they were careful to open all the bones containing
it, and bones so split are frequently the only means of detecting
the former presence of man in some bone caves.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that at that time the shore
of the Atlantic Ocean, during a large part of the Paleolithic
Age, was situated much farther west than it is now, and so in all
probability many refuse heaps are now underneath the waves. From
certain drawings that are found in some French caves, we know
they were used for hunting both seals and whales.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can not doubt that the capture of a whale
afforded as much enjoyment to them as it does to a tribe of
Eskimos now. Bones of birds and fishes are found in many
instances. The salmon appears to have been a favorite among
fishes. Among the birds are found some species now only living in
cold countries, such as the snowy owl, willow grouse, and
flamingo. This is but another proof that the climate of Europe
was then very cold.</p>

<center><img alt="Whale and Seal, Incised on Bone." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Whale_and_seal.jpg" height="267" width="380"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Cave-men were not afraid to attack animals
greatly superior to them in strength. In the Hohlefels Cave in
Germany were found great quantities of the broken and split bones
of cave bears, an animal very similar to the grizzly, and
probably its equal in strength. The reindeer was the main
reliance of these tribes. Its bones are found in great abundance,
and it doubtless was to them all it is to the Lapps of Europe
to-day, except, of course, that it was not domesticated.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Though fire would naturally suggest some rude
method of cooking, we can scarcely find a trace of such
operations, and it has been a matter of conjecture how they
proceeded. Sir John Lubbock thinks they boiled their food, and in
the absence of pottery used wooden or skin vessels, bringing the
water to a boiling point by means of stones heated red hot and
thrown into the water. He points out the presence of peculiarly
shaped stones found in some caves, which he thinks were used for
this purpose.<a href="#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a> It is not
supposed they had any articles of pottery during this epoch. This
is quite an important point, because a knowledge of pottery marks
an important epoch in the culture of a people.</p>

<center><img alt="Cave Bear, Incised on Slate." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Cave_bear.jpg" height="363" width="398"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A people possessed of this knowledge have
passed from Savagism into the lower status of Barbarism.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a> A piece of pottery is as little liable
to destruction as a piece of bone, and so, had those people
possessed pottery, there is no reason why pieces of it should not
be found in every refuse heap, and amongst the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of all caves. But such is not the case; no
fragments of pottery have yet been found which can be referred
with confidence to the epoch of the Cave-men.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some speculations have been indulged in as to
whether the men of this age were cannibals or not. It need
occasion no surprise if they were, since ancient writers assert
that even during historical times this practice prevailed in
Europe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a> Though not definitely
proven there are many facts difficult of explanation, except on
this supposition. However, it may well be that this, after all,
only amounted to the custom of eating parts of an enemy killed in
battle, as certain modern savages do that we would not call
cannibals.<a href="#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not necessary to speak at much length of
the methods of hunting. They had bows and arrows, daggers of
reindeer horn, spears tipped with flint or bone, and harpoons.
Besides, they made a formidable club of the lower jaw-bone of the
cave-bear with its canine tooth still left in its place. Fishing
with nets is not supposed to have been known, Harpooning was
probably their favorite way. M. G. DeMortillet thinks they fished
as follows: They fastened a cord to the middle of a small
splinter of bone. This was then baited, and when swallowed by the
fish, was very certain to get caught in the body.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We know that rude tribes of to-day have many
means of snaring animals. Doubtless similar scenes were enacted
on their primeval hunting-grounds. French books contain
illustrations of the men of this period driving game over
precipitous sides. They had no dogs to assist them in the hunt,
and though reindeer were around them in great abundance, it is
not supposed that they thought of domesticating them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Man is the only animal which seeks to protect
his body from the Summer's heat or the cold of Winter by the use
of clothing. We are, unfortunately, not able to present many
details of the dress of man during the early Stone Age. We are,
however, quite certain that when the climate was severe enough to
permit such animals as the musk-sheep and the reindeer to inhabit
South- western Europe, man must have been provided with an
abundance of warm clothing, though doubtless rudely made and
fashioned. Many reindeer horns found in France are cut and hacked
at the base in such a way as to indicate that it was done when
removing the skins. We also know that the rudest of savage tribes
are never at a loss for some process of tanning hides and
rendering them fit for use. From the immense number and variety
of scrapers found among the cave <i>d&eacute;bris.</i> we are
sure the preparation of clothing occupied no inconsiderable
portion of their time. We also find numerous awls and splinters
of flint and bone, which they doubtless used in exactly the same
manner as similar tools are used by the Lapps to-day in Europe,
that is, to pierce holes in the hides, through which to pass
their rude needle and thread. The needles are made of reindeer
horn, and they were not only smoothly polished, but the eyes are
of such a minute size, and withal so regularly made, that many at
first could not believe they were drilled by the use of flint
alone. This, however, has been shown to be the case by actual
experiments. The thread employed was reindeer tendons, for bones
of these animals are found cut just where they would he cut in
removing these tendons. This cut shows that they protected their
hands by means of long gloves of three or four fingers.<a href=

<center><img alt="Glove, Incised on Bear's Tooth." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Glove_in_tooth.jpg" height="149" width="360"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have thus far been considering those arts
which pertain more directly to living. We have presented some
sketches found engraved on pieces of bone. We first noticed this
among the relics found in one of the Creswell caves in England.
It was also noticed in Belgium. It was among the Cave-men of
Southern France that this artistic trait became highly developed.
Among the reindeer hunters of the Dordogne were artists of no
mean ability. We must pause a minute and mark the bearing of this
taste for art. We have seen many reasons for supposing the men of
the caves much farther advanced in the scale of culture than
those of the Drift, but we have also seen that we can not rank
them higher than the highest grade of savages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Sir John Lubbock thus speaks of them: "In
considering the probable condition of these ancient Cave-men, we
must give them full credit for their love of art, such as it was;
while, on the other hand, the want of metal, of polished flint
implements, and even of pottery, the ignorance of agriculture,
and the apparent absence of all domestic animals, including even
the dog, certainly imply a very low state of civilization."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">They were certainly not as far advanced in
civilization as the next race we will describe, yet the Neolithic
people had no such skill as was possessed by the cave-men. This
need not surprise us, because "an artistic feeling is not always
the offspring of civilization, it is rather a gift of nature. It
may manifest its existence in the most barbarous ages, and may
make its influence more deeply felt in nations which are behind
in respect to general progress than in others which are more
deeply advanced in civilization."<a href=

<p align="JUSTIFY">In regard to the objects themselves, a glance
at the illustrations show us that they are quite faithful
sketches of the animals at that time common. As might be
expected, sketches of the reindeer are numerous. This cut is
regarded as the highest example of Paleolithic art, sketched on a
piece of horn and found in Switzerland. The animal is grazing,
and the grass on which it feeds is seen below. We have on a piece
of slate the outlines of a group of reindeer, generally
considered as representing a fight, though it may mean a hunt,
and that the hunter has succeeded in killing a portion of the
herd. Some, as we see, are on the ground.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It would be exceedingly interesting could we
but find well executed sketches of the men of this period, but,
unfortunately, with one or two exceptions, no representations,
however rude, have yet been discovered of the human form. Perhaps
an explanation of this fact may be found in the well-known
reluctance of savage tribes to have any engravings taken of
themselves, and we can well imagine that if any one was known to
make drawings of human beings he would be regarded with
suspicious distrust, and it would hardly be a safe accomplishment
to possess. One very curious group represents a man, long and
lean, standing between two horses' heads, and by the side of a
long serpent or fish, having the appearance of an eel. On the
reverse side of this piece of horn were represented the heads of
two aurochs or bisons. Mr. Dawkins thinks this also represents a
hunting sketch, and that the man is in the act of striking one of
the horses with a spear.</p>

<center><img alt="Fish, Incised on Bear's Tooth and Ibex." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Fish_Ibex.jpg" height="325" width="332"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On, a fragment of spear-head found in France
several human hands were engraved, but having only four fingers
each. On this point Mr. Lartet assures us that some savage tribes
still depict the hand without the thumb.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a> Representations of birds and reptiles
are very rare; fishes are more common. On a piece of reindeer's
horn was found this representation of the head and chest of an
ibex. Of special interest to us is a representation of a mammoth
found engraved on a piece of mammoth tusk in one of the Dordogne
caves. We have no doubt that the artist who engraved it was
perfectly familiar with the animal itself.</p>

<center><img alt="Mammoth&mdash;La Madeline Cave, France." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Mammoth_France.jpg" height="282" width="585"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Their artistic skill was not confined to the
execution of drawings. They frequently carved pieces of reindeer
horn into various animal forms. Our next cut shows us a dagger,
the handle of which is carved to imitate a reindeer. It will be
seen how the artist has adapted the position of the animal to the
necessities of the case. Flowers are very seldom represented; but
one implement from France has a very nice representation of some
flowering plant engraved on it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Take it all in all, the possession of this
artistic instinct is certainly remarkable&mdash;the more so when
we remember the rudeness of his surroundings, and the few and
simple means at his command for work. "A splinter of flint was
his sole graving tool; a piece of reindeer horn, or a flake of
slate or ivory, was the only plate on which primitive man could
stamp his reproduction of animated nature."<a href=

<center><img alt="Reindeer Carved on Dagger Handle." src=
"images/Ch4_image/Reindeer_carved.jpg" height="122" width=

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some speculations have been indulged in as to
whether we have any traces of a government amongst the
Paleolithic people. That they had some chief or leader is more
than probable. In the caves of France we find a number of
fragments of reindeer horn. Generally speaking, they show
evidence of a good deal of care in making them. They are carved
and ornamented with sketches of various animals, and invariably
have one or more holes bored in the base. The idea has been quite
freely advanced, that these are emblems of authority.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a> And some have pointed out, that,
though they are too light for use as weapons, yet, their
"frequent occurrence, and uniformity of type, show that they
possess a conventional significance."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> Mr. Geikie says that these conjectures
"are mere guess-work."<a href="#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a> And Mr.
Dawkins points out that they are very similar in design and
ornament with an implement of the Eskimos known as an
"arrow-straightener."<a href="#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Whatever may be our conclusions in regard to
these ornamented pieces of reindeer horn, we can not doubt but
that their social instincts found expression in some sort of
alliance for the common good. This is shown by several facts:
such, for instance, as the evidence of trade or barter between
localities considerable distances apart. The inhabitants of
Belgium must have gone to what is now Southern France to procure
the flint they used. They also procured, from the same source,
fossil sea- shells, which they valued highly.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a> We also notice the fact, that certain
localities appear to have been used as the place of manufacture
for certain articles, to the exclusion of others. In other words,
the primitive people appear to have learned the great utility of
a division of labor. One of the caves in Belgium appears to have
been used as a place to make flint implements. Over twenty
thousand articles of flint were found in this cave.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> In France, while in one cave the
implements were all of the spear-head type, in a neighboring cave
horn was almost the only article used in the manufacture of
implements. We must not, however, form an exalted idea of their
trade&mdash;it was simply barter in a rude state of society.<a

<p align="JUSTIFY">Various opinions have been held as to whether
we have any trace of a religious belief. Theoretically speaking,
they had some sort of a religion, though doubtless very vague and
indistinct; for we know of no nation as far advanced as they were
destitute of it.<a href="#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a> It has been
pointed out, that the bones of some animals, as the horse, were
very rare, and their absence explained as the result of
superstitious reasons. It has also been conjectured that some of
the perforated bones and teeth of animals found in various
deposits were amulets worn for religious purposes; and some have
gone so far as to infer, that the ornamentations on some of these
so-called amulets represent the sun, and that, consequently,
sun-worship prevailed among the Cave-men. While these various
conjectures are, of course, possible, it is equally certain they
are all "mere guess-work."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Early explorers describe with considerable
degree of confidence the manner of burial among the Cave-men, and
inferred from the remains found buried with the bodies that they
had some notion of a life beyond the grave&mdash;and,
accordingly, placed near the body food and drink to support him
on his journey, weapons wherewith to defend himself, and his
favorite implements, so that, arrived at the land of spirits, he
would be well provided for. These result are not borne out by
later investigations. The instance mentioned most prominently,
that of the burial cave at Aurignac, France, has been shown to
have no bearing on the question, as every thing indicates that
the burials were of a much later date.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have yet a most important question before
us&mdash;one that is still engaging the attention of scientific
men in Europe. That is the question of race. Who were these early
tribes? Are they in any way connected with the men of the Drift?
Have we any representations of them now living upon the earth? On
these questions there is quite a diversity of opinion. In various
caves in France and Belgium, skulls and other bones of the human
skeleton have been found. These have been studied with care by
the best scholars in Europe; and B. Carfares has set forth the
results in his various works, in which he connects them, not only
with the men of the River Drift, but with the race of men that
inhabited Europe during the succeeding Neolithic Age, and,
indeed, with men now living in France and Belgium.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is no question as to the correctness of
these inferences &mdash;the only one is, whether the skulls and
fragmentary skeletons are really remains of the Cave-men. This
must be made perfectly clear and unquestioned before we are to
accept them. Mr. Darkens reviews the various cases where
skeletons have been found in caves.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a> He points out that, in every instance,
very serious doubts can be raised as to whether they are really
remains of the Cave-men or not.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Until these objections are met, we do not see
how the opinion of B. Carfares (above) can be accepted. But if
these instances are not accepted, then, in all other instances
where there is no doubt, the remains are in such a fragmentary
condition that no conclusion can be made from them. So as far as
remains of the human skeleton are concerned, we can form no
conclusions as to the race to which the Cave-men belonged.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have already noted, that the Cave-men came
into Europe much later than the men of the Drift, and that their
range was very limited, corresponding, in fact, with that of the
northern group of animals. When the cold of the Glacial Age
passed away, the musk-sheep, reindeer, and other animals, were
driven out of Europe. They are found now only in high northern
latitudes, such as Greenland. Mr. Darkens thinks that there,
also, are to be found the Cave-men of the Paleolithic Age, now
known as the Eskimos. Though not accepted by all authorities, yet
some of our best scholars find much to commend in this
theory.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have undoubted proofs that, in America, the
Eskimos formerly lived much farther south.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> And Dr. Abbot thinks the Paleolithic
implements discovered in New Jersey, bearing such striking
resemblance to those of Europe, are undoubtedly their work.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a> Therefore, there is no absurdity
in asserting that they once lived in Western Europe; the more so,
when we reflect that the climate, the animals&mdash;in fact, all
their surroundings&mdash; must have been similar to those of
their present habitats.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When we come to examine the customs and habits
of these Eskimos, we are at once struck with their resemblance to
what we have seen was the probable state of life among the
Cave-men. At Solute, for instance, we have vast refuse heaps of
bones of animals. We find similar heaps around the rude huts of
the Eskimos to-day. Captain Parry describes one as follows: "In
every direction round the huts were lying innumerable bones of
walruses and seals, together with skulls of dogs, bears, and
foxes."<a href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Other points of comparison strike us when
reading Sir John Lubbock's account of their habits and customs.
For instance: "Their food, if cooked at all, is broiled or
boiled; their vessels, being of stone or wood, can not, indeed,
be put on the fires, but heated stones are thrown in until the
water becomes hot enough and the food is cooked." "Their food
consists principally of reindeer, musk-ox, walrus, seals, birds,
and salmon. They will, however, eat any kind of animal food. They
are very fond of fat and marrow, to get at which they pound the
bones with a stone." "The clothes of the Eskimos are made from
the skins of the reindeer, seals, and birds, sewn together with
sinews. For needles they use the bones of either birds or
fishes." "The Eskimos have also a great natural ability for
drawing. In many cases they have made rude maps for our officers,
which have turned out to be substantially correct. Many of their
bone implements are covered with sketches."</p>

<center><img alt="Eskimo Art." src="images/Ch4_image/Eskimo_art.jpg"
height="132" width="596"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In this cut we have a bone drill on which are
sketched reindeer, geese, a braider or flat-bottomed boat, a tent
around which various articles of clothing are hung up to dry, a
woman apparently engaged in the preparation of food, and a
hunting scene.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, we know that savage tribes, widely
separated by time and space, will, after all, under the pressure
of common necessities, invent much the same implements and live
much the same life. But still, where every thing seems to
coincide, the climate, the animals, the mode of life proved the
same, and especially when both are seen possessed of a common
artistic skill, together with the known fact that in the Western
Continent the Eskimos did formerly live much farther south; there
is surely a strong case made out, and therefore the probabilities
are that the Eskimos are the representatives of the Cave-men of
Europe.<a href="#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> And yet we must be
cautious on this point; or rather we remember that the phrase,
"predecessors of the Eskimos," does not imply that they were in
all respects like them. An examination of the rude sketches of
the Cave-men left by themselves seems to indicate that the whole
body was covered with hair. "The hunter in the Antler from Duluth
Cave has a long, pointed beard, and a high crest of hair on the
poll utterly unlike the Eskimo type. The figures are also those
of a slim and long-jointed man."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This completes our review of the Paleolithic
people, and it only remains to present some general conclusions.
The Glacial or Pleistocene Age is seen to have been of immense
duration, and characterized by great changes in climate. We have
found that two races of men occupied Europe during this time. The
men of the River Drift are the most ancient.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that they can be traced over
wide-extended areas. They seem to have invaded Europe, along with
the great invasion of animals from Asia, constituting the
temperate group of animals; and with those animals they probably
shifted back and forth, as the cold of the Glacial Age increased
or waned. These people seem to have completely vanished. At a
later date, when the cold of the Glacial Age was once more
severe, associated with animals now living only in high northern
latitudes, came the Cave-men, whose discussion has formed the
subject of this chapter.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It will be seen how much we owe to patient
investigators. The results are, indeed, bewildering. They make us
acquainted with a people the very existence of whom was not known
a few years back. Though the whole life of those ancient races
seemed hopelessly lost in the night of time, the gloom is
irradiated by the light of modern science, which lays before our
astonished vision the remains of arts and industries of the
primitive tribes that occupied Europe during the morning-time of
human life.</p>

caverns of Belgium into two epochs. He considers them to be the
remains of the same people, some tribes being, perhaps, farther
advanced than others. Mr. Dawkins is, of course, high authority,
but we think his argument could also be applied to prove there
was no real difference between the men of the River Drift and the
so-called Cave-men. This, in fact, is the opinion of many,
including Mr. Evans, who is exceptionally well qualified to judge
of these remains. We think, however, in view of the evidence
adduced by Mr. Pengelly, Mr. Geikie, Mr. Dawkins, and others, few
will venture to doubt that there is a wide difference between the
men of the River Drift and those of the Caves.</li>

<li>French writers make four divisions of these caves, according
to the degree of finish, which the specimens show. Mr. Dawkins
does not think the difference in the implements sufficient to
justify this view. With the possible exception of Le Moustier, as
stated above, we think his view correct, which is also the
opinion of Mr. Evans. ("Ancient Stone Implements," p. 439.)</li>

valuable work, "Recent Origin of Man," p. 195, <i>et seq.,</i>
argues that pottery was known at this time, and cites instances
where it is stated to have been found. This is the opinion of
Figuier also. ("Primitive Man," p. 54.) But Mr. Dawkins points
out that these pieces of pottery are clearly of a Neolithic
style, and does not think it proven that they are of Paleolithic
age. Mr. Geikie also denies that there is any proof that they
were acquainted with the potter's art. ("Prehistoric Europe," p.
18.) So the highest place in the scale of civilization we can
assign these people to is that of Upper Savageism.</li>
