height="178" width="165" align="LEFT"> THE energy and skill of
Columbus were crowned with success, and the storm-tossed Atlantic
was found to lave the shores of a western continent, reflecting
minds in Europe were much interested in the strange stories they
heard of the inhabitants of the New World. On the one hand
Spanish adventurers told scarcely credited stories of populous
cities, temples glittering with gold and silver ornaments, and
nations possessed of a barbaric civilization scarcely inferior to
their own. On the other hand were accounts of morose savages,
cruel and vindictive in nature, depending on fishing and the
chase for a livelihood. Nearly four centuries have elapsed since
that time. The aboriginal inhabitants have nearly disappeared,
leaving their origin and prehistoric life almost as great a
riddle to us as it was to the early colonists.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But in endeavoring to unroll the pages of
their history, we have chanced upon some strange discoveries. The
Aztecs, that people whose culture is to-day such an enigma to our
scholars, are known to be a late arrival in the valley of
Anahuac. They were preceded in that section by a mysterious
people, the Toltecs, whose remains excite our liveliest
curiosity, but of which we have yet learned but little. Yucatan
is shown to have been for many centuries the home of a people
whose advancement equated that of the Aztecs at their palmiest
day. Like important discoveries attended the labors of explorers
in the North. The entire valley of its great river is known to
have been the home of a numerous population, that, from the
nature of their remains, we call the Mound-builders. Who these
people were, when and whence they came, and whither they went,
are questions whose solution is by no means accomplished. Nor are
such discoveries the only results. A study of their institutions
has done much in revealing the constructions of ancient society,
and thereby throwing light on some mysterious chapters of man's
existence.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Of late years interest in the antiquity of man
in America has been reawaked by the discoveries of human remains
in Pliocene deposits in California, and the Glacial gravel of the
Delaware at Trenton, New Jersey. Before this it was supposed that
we had no authentic instance of human remains in America found
under such circumstances that it was necessary to assign to them
a profound antiquity. If these latter day discoveries be true, we
can not escape the conclusion that man lived in America at as
early a date as that indicated by any of the European
explorations. Some hold that the proof of his existence here in
Pliocene times is far more satisfactory than any evidence of his
presence in Europe during this time. There is something
fascinating in this belief. If some of the most eminent
scientists of America are not mistaken, man lived on our Pacific
coast before the great ice-sheets that pulverized the surface of
the earth and dispersed life before them came down from the
north. He ranged along the western rivers before the volcanic
peaks of the Sierras were uplifted, and his old hunting-grounds
are to-day buried underneath the greet lava flow which desolated
ancient California and Oregon. But this assertion has not been
allowed to pass undisputed, nor has it received the assent of all
scientists.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can easily understand why scholars subject
all questions relating to the first appearance of man to very
careful scrutiny. If a competent geologist should assert that he
had found, in undoubted Pliocene formations, bones of some
species of animals not hitherto suspected of living at that date,
his statement would be accepted as proof of the same. But in the
case of man, every circumstance is inquired into. It is but right
that the utmost care should be exercised in this direction. But,
on the other hand, we are not justified in demanding mathematical
demonstration in every case of the accuracy of a reported
discovery. Yet such seems to be the position of a portion of the
scientific world. For, although they willingly admit that man has
lived on the earth for a very long time indeed, they urge all
sorts of objections to extending that time into a past geological
age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Accordingly, when Professor Whitney states as
the result of many years spent in the investigation of the
Tertiary formation of California, that he finds evidence of the
existence of man in the Pliocene Age, it is not strange that one
part of the scientific world listens incredulously to his
statements, and are at once ready to explain away the facts on
which he relies. He may, of course, be mistaken, for it is human
to err, but his proofs are sufficiently strong to convince some
of the best scholars in America. We can do no more than to lay
the facts before the reader and let him judge for himself.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen what a genial climate prevailed
in Europe during the Tertiary Age. This must also have been true
of California. A rich and varied vegetation decked the land. The
great trees of California of our day then flourished in
Greenland, Iceland, and Western Europe. The cypress of the
Southern States was then growing in Alaska and other high
northern latitudes. The climate probably passed from a tropical
one, in early Tertiary times, to a milder or temperate one in
Pliocene times. Amongst the animals inhabiting America were three
species of camels. Rhinoceroses, mastodons, and elephants trooped
over the land. Tigers and other carnivore prowled in the forests.
Herds of horse-like animals, one scarcely distinguishable from
our common horse, grazed in the valleys, along with several
species of deer. From the presence of the old drainage beds, we
know that majestic rivers rolled their watery burden through the
land. Such a country might well afford a home for man if he were
present.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To understand fully the course of events which
now took place we must venture on geological ground. The great
Pacific Ocean, lying to the west of America, is constantly
exerting a lateral pressure, which during Tertiary times showed
its effect in the uplifting of the great mountain ranges of the
western coast.<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a> During late
Tertiary times, as a counterpart to the upward movement, a great
subsidence commenced in the Pacific region.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a> Doubtless many islands, some think an
entire continent even, disappeared beneath the waves. The
completion of the various mountain ranges left the coast firm and
unyielding; hence, as it could not bend before the fiery flood
forced upward from below by the downward motion just mentioned,
it broke, and the torrent of molten rock leaped out as a lava
flow. In consequence of this, near the close of Pliocene times,
the surface of California and Oregon, especially the north of
California, became buried under the lava and ashes of the most
desolating volcanic outbreak that the earth has ever known.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us now see what bearing this has on the
question of the antiquity of man. Scattered here and there
throughout California are numerous masses of basaltic lava, which
appear as elevated ridges, the softer strata around having been
denuded away. They have received the general name of Table
Mountains. They have not only been noted for their picturesque
beauty, but miners long since found that the gravels underneath
the lava covering were rich in gold. In Tuolumne County the Table
Mountain is a flow of lava which originated in lofty volcanoes
several miles away.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It extends along the north side of the
Stanilaus, which is a small river flowing in a south-westerly
course through the county. The mountain is in the form of a ridge
about two thousand feet above the present level of the river. At
one point the river breaks through this ridge, which has been
worn away for a considerable distance. From this point the ridge
appears as a continuous mountain, stretching away to the south
for a distance of twenty miles, from where it crosses the river.
"As seen from a distance the Table Mountain reveals its origin at
once, in the contrast between the long, straight line of its
upper edge and the broken and curving ones which the eroded hills
of the auriferous strata everywhere exhibit. Its dark color and
comparative absence of trees and shrubs on its top and sides also
indicate very clearly that the materials of which it is composed
are very different from that of the surrounding hills."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is the celebrated Table Mountain of
Tuolumne County. It is simply a vast flow of lava. It must have
been a grand sight when this river of fire came rolling down from
its volcanic fount. Its present position on top of an elevated
ridge is a very singular one. In explanation of that we arrive at
some very important conclusions, and we can not fail to be
impressed with the fact that countless ages have rolled away
since that lava flood poured down the mountain side. "No one can
deny that a stream of melted lava, running for forty miles down
the slope of the Sierra, must have sought and found a depression
or valley in which to flow; for it is impossible that it should
have maintained for any distance its position on the crest of a
ridge." Lava is about as thick as molten iron, and would as
surely seek some valley in which to flow as would so much water.
"The valley of the Stanilaus, now two thousand feet deep, could
not then have existed; for this flow of lava is clearly seen to
have crossed it at one point."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">"The whole face of the country must,
therefore, have undergone an entire change since the eruption
took place, during which this mass of lava was poured out. The
valley of the Stanilaus must have then been occupied by a range
of mountains. The same is true of the other side, where now is
the valley of Wood's Creek; for such ranges must have existed in
order to form and wall in the valley in which the current of lava
flowed. There has been, therefore, an amount of denudation during
the period since this volcanic mass took its position of not less
than three or four thousand feet of perpendicular depth, and this
surprising series of changes is not peculiar to one locality, but
the whole slope of the Sierras, through the gold region, is the
scene of similar volcanic outflows and subsequent remodeling of
the surface into a new series of reliefs and depressions."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Imaginary Section of Table Mountain." src=
"images/Ch9_image/Table_mount.jpg" height="256" width="359"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to fully realize the change here
spoken of, an imaginary section of Table Mountains is here
presented. Here we see the two valleys on the sides, and the mass
of lava covering the top of the mountain. The dotted lines
represent the position of the old line of hills, which must once
have inclosed the valley down which coursed the fiery
torrent.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We require to dwell on this, fact before we
can fully understand its meaning. The "eternal hills," two and
three thousand feet in height, have been completely washed away,
and where they stood is now a deep valley. But the old valley,
protected by its stony covering, is now a mountain ridge; and
this, we are told, is not a solitary instance, but the entire
surface of the country has been thus denuded. We stand in awe
before the stupendous results, which nature, working through vast
cycles of time, has accomplished.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But if this lava flow took place in a
pre-existing valley, we ought to find under the rocky covering
beds of gravel, rolled stones, and other <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
peculiar to a river bed. Such, in fact, we do find extended along
directly underneath the lava, about fifteen hundred feet above
the general level of the country. These old river gravels are
found to be very rich in gold, and miners have tunneled into them
in numerous places in search of the valuable metal. In order to
determine the geological age of these gravels, and subsequent
lava flow, a careful examination of portions of plants and bones
of animals found therein has been made. The plants are pronounced
by competent authority<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> to be
Pliocene, totally distinct from any specimens now growing in
California. The animal remains are rhinoceroses, camels, and an
extinct species of horse. The age of these gravels is, therefore,
pronounced to be Pliocene. We would say in this connection that
the auriferous gravels of California have been the object of a
very careful research by Prof. Whitney. He adds to his
conclusions that of another of the State geologists. We need not
give in detail his arguments, but he reaches the conclusion that
the auriferous gravels of the Pacific slope represent the whole
of the Tertiary Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that in the ancient gravels of
European rivers arch&aelig;ologists have found the materials
wherewith to build a fascinating story of man's appearance in
Quaternary times. We have underneath the lava flow of California
the gravel beds of rivers far antedating the gravels of the
Somme. It is therefore not a little interesting to learn from
Prof. Whitney that he finds many proofs of the existence of man
in the gravels of the Pliocene Age in California. Under the solid
basalt of Table Mountain have been found many works of men's
hands, as well as the celebrated "Calaveras Skull."</p>

<img alt="Calaveras Skull." src="images/Ch9_image/skull.jpg" height=
"246" width="215" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">This skull was taken from a mining shaft at
Altaville, at a depth of one hundred and thirty feet from the
surface, beneath seven different strata of lava and gravel. Prof.
Whitney was not present when it was found. He, however, made it
his business to examine into the facts of the case, and he thus
speaks of it: "That the skull was found in these old, intact,
cemented gravels has been abundantly proved by evidence that can
not be gainsaid." And again: "So far as human and geological
testimony can at present be relied on, there is no question but
that the skull was found under Table Mountain, and is of the
Pliocene Age."<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This would seem to be pretty explicit, but, as
we have said before, Prof. Whitney, in his formal report as the
State geologist of California, reaches the conclusion that the
auriferous gravels of the Pacific are all of the Tertiary Age. It
is therefore not a little interesting to learn that numerous
instances are recorded of the finding of human remains or the
works of man in these gravels. Prof. Whitney mentions twenty such
instances.<a href="#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a> Mr. Bancroft
furnishes us a list of such discoveries, giving as his authority
Mr. C. D. Voy, of the California Geological Survey, of Oakland,
California. He states that Mr. Voy personally visited most of the
localities where the discoveries were made, and took all possible
pains to verify their authenticity, and in many cases obtaining
sworn statements from the parties who made them.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Two stone mortars and spear-heads, six and
eight inches long, were found in the gravel under Table Mountain,
just mentioned. These relics were found about three hundred feet
from the surface. A hundred feet and more of this depth was of
solid lava. At another place a stone bead was found three hundred
feet from the mouth of the tunnel, under a thick layer of lava.
Many other instances might be given of such discoveries, not
always under lava coverings, but always in such instances that we
are compelled to assign to them an immense antiquity. As, for
instance, at San Andreas, according to a sworn statement in Mr.
Voy's possession, large stone mortars were taken from a layer of
cemented gravel, overlain by one hundred and twenty-five feet of
volcanic and gravel materials. Many similar instances are on
record, but enough have been mentioned to serve the purpose of
the chapter.<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we have briefly gone over the ground on
which the antiquity of man in America is, by some, referred to
the Pliocene Age, it is but fair to notice some of the objections
that have been raised. It is not necessary to point out that the
only questions worthy to be considered are of a scientific
nature.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must deny either the age of the gravels
themselves or that the objects of human handiwork were found as
claimed, or else that they are of the same age as the gravels.
Prof. LeConte thinks, from the nature of the gravels and the
peculiar circumstances which surround them, that they are not
older than the close of the Pliocene Age. He thinks they, in
fact, belong to the transitory period between that age and the
Quaternary.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a> But as we are
considering the question of Pliocene man, it makes but little
difference if the gravels do belong to the very close of that
period. They may still be called Pliocene.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One great trouble with those remains is that
they were not discovered by professed geologists. We have to
depend upon the statements of miners. But if their statements can
be believed (and why should they not?), there is no doubt about
their genuineness. The testimony, as Mr. Whitney says, "all
points in one direction, and there has never been any attempt
made to pass off on any member of the survey any thing out of
keeping, or&mdash;so to speak&mdash;out of harmony with what has
been already found, or might be expected to be found. It has
always been the same kind of implements which have been exhibited
to us, namely, the coarsest and the least finished, which one
would suppose could be made, and still be implements at all."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> This result would hardly be
possible, where so many parties are concerned in furnishing the
evidence, if the objects were not genuine.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In opposition to this conclusion it has been
urged that the stone mortars, pestles, etc., have become imbedded
in the gravel by the action of streams, or slips from the
mountain side in modern times, or are the results of interments
or mining operations.<a href="#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a> As an
illustration of how they might become buried by the action of
streams, reference is made to somewhat similar discoveries in the
tin-bearing streams of Cornwall (Wales). We know with
considerable certainty that at a very early date the
Ph&oelig;nicians worked in the gravels of these streams for tin
ores. Implements made use of by them and others&mdash;such, for
instance, as shovels, mortars, pick-axes, stone bowls, and
various dishes&mdash;have been found at all depths in this
gravel, by more modern miners.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This may explain the presence, in some
instances, of similar remains in California, but it utterly fails
to do so, where the remains have been buried underneath a lava
flow or a bed of volcanic materials, as is the case in many of
the instances we have cited. Manifestly no water has disturbed
their strata since the volcanic materials were laid down. Neither
can we think of a land-slide carrying these remains into the
heart of a mountain, or burying them underneath a hundred feet of
lava. The peculiar position in which they were often found is
surely lost sight of by those who think they might have been
placed there by interment. We can not think of a savage people
digging a grave in such a position.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It has been urged with considerable force that
these relics have been left behind by ancient miners when they
mined for gold. Dr. Wilson is cited as authority for the
statement that the Mexicans obtained "silver, lead, and tin from
the mines of Tasco and copper was wrought in the mountains of
Zacotollan by means of galleries and shafts, opened with
persevering toil where the metallic veins were imbedded in the
solid rock." Prescott, the historian, also testifies to the same
fact.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We need only add to this, that wherever these
ancient galleries were opened in the solid rock, they still
exist. Schoolcraft mentions finding one two hundred and ten feet
deep.<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a> The chances are not worth
considering, that these old mines would be overlooked. If, for
instance, the Calaveras skull is that of a prehistoric miner,
killed in an old mining gallery only a thousand years or so ago,
it is inconceivable that all evidence of this mine should have
disappeared. Or, if in one case it should have done so, it would
surely have been detected in other instances. The variety and
explicitness of the testimony brought forward makes all such
supposition improbable.<a href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is best, in this matter, to hold the
judgment in suspense. We have stated Mr. Whitney's position, and
the objections that have been raised to it. The amount of thought
bestowed on the antiquity of man will doubtless soon clear up the
whole matter. We can not do better than to consider his
surroundings, supposing that he was really present. The country
must have been very different from the California of to-day. Dr.
Cooper says, "The country consisted of peninsulas and islands,
like those of the present East Indies; resembling them also in
climate and productions."<a href="#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a> The
probabilities are that to the west and southwest of California,
instead of watery expanse of the Pacific, only broken here and
there by an ever-verdant islet, there was either a continental
expanse of land or, at any rate, a vast archipelago. We know that
over a large part of the Northern Pacific area the land has sunk
not less than six thousand feet since late Tertiary times.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are certain the ocean area must have
presented a vastly different aspect before that depression
commenced. It is not unreasonable to suppose that communication
between North America and Asia was much easier than in subsequent
epochs. It might have been an easy matter for man to pass back
and forth without losing sight of land. It is therefore
reasonable to suppose that if Pliocene man was in existence, he
would have occupied both sides of the Pacific at this early
time.<a href="#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a> These last conclusions
are very important ones to reach, and as there is reasonable
foundation for them, we must bear them in mind in the subsequent
pages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It will be remembered that the races of men
who inhabited Europe in the Paleolithic Age had only very rudely
formed, unpolished implements. It is not until we arrive at the
Neolithic stage of culture that we meet with specimens of
polished stone implements. To judge from the specimens of early
Californian art, the beautifully polished pestles, beads,
plummets or sinkers, spear-heads, etc., Pliocene man in
California must have been in the Neolithic stage of culture.
Though they were not acquainted with the potter's art, yet from
their skill in working vessels of stone, they had undoubtedly
passed entirely through Savagism, and had entered the confines of
Barbarism,<a href="#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a> as far advanced, in
fact, as many of the Indian tribes the Spaniards found in
possession of the country.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It must be confessed this seems very singular.
It is this statement that causes many to shut their eyes to what
would be otherwise at once admitted and refuse to believe the
genuineness of the discovery. If the implements brought to light
had been of the rude River Drift type&mdash;celts but little
removed from nodules of flint&mdash;scholars would not be so
cautious about accepting them. But when we learn they are
Neolithic, we at once see why they hesitate, and ask for more
conclusive proofs; yet this is no reason to disregard the
discoveries. They may be a great surprise, they may be an
unwelcome discovery to the holder of some theories, yet the only
question is, whether they are true or not, and if true, theories
must be modified to fit the facts. Prof. Putnam thus speaks, in
reference to them: "As the arch&aelig;ologist has no right to be
governed by any pre-conceived theories, but must take the facts
as he finds them, it is impossible for him to do otherwise than
accept the deductions of so careful and eminent a geologist as
Prof. Whitney, and draw his conclusions accordingly,
notwithstanding the fact that this Pliocene man was, to judge by
his works in stone and shell, as far advanced as his descendants
were at the time of the discovery of California by the
Spaniards."<a href="#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps a partial explanation of this matter
may be found when we consider all the circumstances of the case.
The origin of man is generally assigned to some tropical country.
Sir John Lubbock thus speaks of it: "Our nearest relatives in the
animal kingdom are confined to hot, almost tropical climates; and
it is in such countries that we are, perhaps, most likely to find
the earliest traces of the human race."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a> This is also the opinion of other
eminent scholars. M. Quatrefages thinks that man probably
originated in Asia. He points out, however, that, during Tertiary
times, the climate was much milder, and man might have originated
in Northern Asia.<a href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a> Now, if it be
true that a great mass of land has disappeared beneath the waves
of the Pacific, why may we not suppose that, if this sunken land
was not the original home of man, it was at a very early time
inhabited by him; that here he passed through his experience in
savagism?<a href="#Refer"><sup>26</sup></a> We know how suited
the islands of the Pacific are to the needs of a savage people;
and we must not lose sight of the probable ease with which they
could reach the coast of California&mdash;and also of what Dr.
Cooper has told us of the climate and geographical surroundings
of California at that early time. So it may not be unreasonable
to suppose that man reached California long ages before he
wandered into Europe, and so reached the Neolithic stage of
culture much earlier than he did in other parts of the world.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It might be objected, that if a people in the
Neolithic stage of culture lived in California in the Pliocene
Age, they ought to have reached a very high stage of culture
indeed when the Spaniards invaded the country. This is what we
would expect had they been left to develop themselves. The great
geographical changes that took place near the close of the
Pliocene would cut off the primitive Californians from the
Asiatics. Not only was the land connection&mdash;if it indeed
existed&mdash;now destroyed, but causes were changing the
climate. Ice and snow drove from the north life of both animals
and plants, and for an entire geological period communications
with Asia by way of the north must have been very difficult, if
not cut off altogether. Who can tell what changes now came to the
Asiatic branch of these people? We are but too familiar with the
fact that nations and races sicken and die: many examples could
be given. The natives of the Sandwich Islands seem doomed to
extinction. In a few centuries, the Indians of America will live
only in tradition and song.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Such may have been the fate of the early
inhabitants of the Pacific continent: certainly it would not be
surprising, if the immense climatic and geographical changes
which then took place would produce that result. Or it may be
that but a scanty remnant lived on, absorbed by more vigorous,
though less highly cultivated stocks of the same people, whose
homes had been on the main-land of Asia&mdash;and the remnant
left along the Pacific coast must have lived on under vastly
different circumstance. The interior of North America was largely
a dreary expanse of ice and snow down to the 39th parallel of
latitude. It is quite true, this great glacier did not reach the
Pacific Slope; but it must have exerted a powerful influence on
the climate: and the evidence points, that the Sierra Nevada were
occupied by local glaciers which reached down into the fertile
expanse of the plains.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This was certainly a far different climate,
and a far different country, than that which sustained a
vegetation of a tropical growth. It may well be that the people
should, as a result of their changed conditions, have
deteriorated in culture; or, at any rate, their progress toward
civilization may have been stopped, and many thousands of years
may have passed with no perceptible improvement. It may be
objected, that man will improve under any state of existence,
give him time enough. This is, doubtless, in the main true. But a
race may early reach its limit of culture; in which case, as a
race, it will not improve: we may do much with the individual,
but nothing, or but very little, for the race.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In these considerations which have been
advanced we may find some reason for the early appearance of
Neolithic man, as well as the fact that he advanced no farther in
culture. But whether man first arrived in California in Pliocene
times or not, he continued to inhabit the land to the present
day. He would, however, be exposed to assault after assault from
invading tribes. We do not wish to examine the question of the
origin of the native Americans. It is held, by the best
authorities, that at least a portion of them came from Asia,
using the Kurile Islands as a stepping stone. Reaching the
main-land of America, and passing down the coast, they would,
sooner or later, reach the Valley of the Columbia&mdash;which has
been characterized as the most extraordinary region on the face
of the earth in the variety and amount of subsistence it afforded
to tribes destitute of a knowledge of agriculture. At certain
seasons of the year the rivers are crowded with fish, and they
are then caught with the greatest ease. As a mixture of forest
and prairie, the country is an excellent one for game. A species
of bread-root grew on the prairies; and, in the Summer, there was
a profusion of berries. To these advantages must be added that of
a mild and equable climate.<a href="#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These combined advantages would make this
valley one of the centers of population, from whence would issue
successive bands of invading people. A portion of these, passing
over into California, would come in contact with the descendants
of Pliocene man. The result would be, that the primitive
inhabitants, unable to escape to the west, would come in contact
with wave after wave of invading tribes. This is not altogether
theory. All inquirers into the customs, arts, and languages of
the primitive Californians have been struck with the remarkable
commingling of the same. We are driven to the conclusion that
here has been the meeting ground of many distinct tribes and
nations. "From such a mixture, and over-population of the most
desirable portions of the country, would naturally result the
formation of the hundreds of petty tribes that existed in both
Upper and Lower California when first known to the Spaniards."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In view of these facts, it is not strange that
no advance in culture is noticeable; and the grounds just
mentioned may go far to explain why we catch sight, here and
there, of bits of customs, habits, and manners of life which
strangely remind us of widely distant people&mdash;though it will
not explain the presence of words of Malay or Chinese origin
which are claimed to exist.<a href="#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a>
What is known as the Eskimo trace is quite marked in the physical
characters and in the arts of the Californians.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a> It is, probably, the continuance of
the type of the primitive American race.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It would naturally be interesting to know
whether any date can be given for the Pliocene Age, and so give
us some ideas as to the antiquity of man, if he were really here
during that epoch. This, however, is one of the most difficult
questions to answer, and in the present state of our knowledge
incapable of solution. Approximations have, of course, been made,
and, as might be expected, vary greatly in results. When it was
acknowledged on all hands that on geological grounds the age of
the earth was certainly very great, many times the few thousand
years hitherto relied on, it is not strange that popular thought
swung to the other extreme, and hundreds of millions of years
were thought necessary to explain the series of changes which the
geologists unfolded. This demand for a greatly extended time was
strengthened when the law of the gradual evolution of life was
expounded by the modern school of naturalists, and as great a
lapse of time as five hundred millions of years was not deemed an
extravagant estimate. Sir William Thompson has, however,
demonstrated that the time that has elapsed since the crust of
the earth became solidified can not be far from one hundred
millions of years, and consequently we know the time since the
appearance of life must be greatly less than that number of
years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Attempts have been made to estimate the length
of time required to form the sedimentary crust of the earth. The
results are so divergent on this point that it is best not to
adopt any standard at present. Our views on this matter are also
dependent on the time that has elapsed since the close of the
Glacial Age, which, as we have seen, is not yet a settled point.
If it be true that the islands of the Pacific commenced to sink
during late Tertiary times, then we have a measure of that time
in the growth of coral, which has required at least four hundred
thousand years to form reefs the thickness of some that are known
to exist.<a href="#Refer"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But here, again, it seems we are not certain
when this depression commenced.<a href="#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a>
In a previous chapter we have gone over the Glacial Age, and have
seen when, according to Mr. Croll's theory, it commenced. This
was probably not far from the close of the Pliocene Age. We might
as well leave the matter here. There are so many elements of
uncertainty that it is doubtful if we will ever be able to assign
satisfactory dates to the epoch.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In bringing to a conclusion this somewhat
extended notice of early man in California we have to admit that
much of it is speculative; still it is an endeavor to explain
known facts. The main statement is that man lived in California
in the Pliocene Age, in the Neolithic stage of culture. Whether
the arguments adduced in support of this statement are sufficient
to prove its accuracy must be left to the mature judgment of the
scientific world. There is no question but that the climate and
geography, the fauna and the flora, were then greatly different
from those of the present. Starting with these known facts, so
strange and fascinating, it need occasion no surprise, if the pen
of the enthusiastic explorer depict a scene wherein facts and
fancy are united.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In this case truth is certainly stranger than
fiction, and when, in imagination, we see the great Pacific
archipelago emerge from the waves, and, in place of the long
swell of the ocean, we picture the pleasing scenes of tropic
lands, the strange floral growth of a past geological age, the
animal forms which have since disappeared, with man already well
advanced in culture: when we recall all this, and picture forth
the surprising changes which then took place, the slowly
subsiding land, the encroaching waters, and the resultant watery
waste, with here and there a coral-girt island, the great
volcanic uplift on the main-land, the flaming rivers of molten
lava, which come pouring forth, followed by the night of cold,
ice, and snow: when we consider these, and the great lapse of
time necessary for their accomplishment, how powerless are mere
words to set forth the grandeur and the resistless sweep of
nature's laws, and to paint the insignificance and trifling
nature of man and his works!</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The discoveries in California are not the only
instances of the relics of man and his works found under such
circumstances that they are relied on by some to prove the great
age of man in America. But on account of the rarity of these
finds, and the contradictory statements and opinions respecting
them, the scientific world has until lately regarded with some
distrust the assertion of a great antiquity for man on this
continent; but a review of the evidence on this point, and
especially of Dr. Abbott's discoveries in New Jersey, must
impress on all the conclusion that tribes of men were living here
at the close of the Glacial Age, and probably long before that
time.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It need occasion no surprise to learn that
several of the discoveries of former years, relied on in this
connection, have since been shown to be unreliable. They have not
been able to stand a careful examination at the hands of later
scholars. They were made when European savants were first
communicating to the world the results of the explorations of the
river gravels and caves of that country. The antiquity of man
being amply proven there, may afford some explanation why more
discriminating care was not employed. Of this nature were some of
the discoveries in the valley of the Mississippi; such, for
instance, as the portion of the human skeleton found mingled with
the bones of extinct animals a few miles below Natchez, and the
deeply buried skeleton at New Orleans, in both of which cases a
simple explanation is at hand without the necessity of supposing
a great flight of years.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some of these discoveries yet remain an
unsettled point. Such is the discovery of flint arrow-heads in
connection with the bones of a mastodon found in Missouri. Dr.
Koch, who made the discovery, draws from the facts of the case
such a suggestive picture that we will give his own words. After
describing where found, he says: "The greater portion of these
bones had been more or less burned by fire. The fire had extended
but a few feet beyond the space occupied by the animal before its
destruction, and there was more than sufficient evidence that the
fire had not been an accidental one, but, on the contrary, that
it had been kindled by human agency, and, according to all
appearance, with the design of killing the huge creature which
had been found mired in the mud, and in an entirely helpless
condition. All the bones which had not been burned by the fire
had kept their original position, standing upright and apparently
quite undisturbed in the clay, whereas those portions which had
been extended above the surface had been partially consumed by
the fire, and the surface of the clay was covered, as far as fire
had extended, by a layer of wood ashes, mingled with larger or
smaller pieces of charred wood and burnt bones, together with
bones belonging to the spine, ribs, and other parts of the body,
which had been more or less injured by the fire. It seemed that
the burning of the victim and the hurling of rocks at it had not
satisfied the destroyers, for I found also, among the ashes,
bones, and rocks, several arrow-heads, a stone spear-head, and
some stone axes."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Such is Dr. Koch's very interesting statement
of this find. "It was received by the scientific world," says
Foster, "with a sneer of contempt," and, it seems to us, for very
insufficient reasons. It is admitted that his knowledge of
geology was not as accurate as it should have been. He made some
mistakes of this nature, which have been clearly shown.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> Still, he is known to have been a
diligent collector, and we are told "no one who knew him will
question but that he was a competent observer."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> It seems to us useless to deny the
truth of his statements. There is, however, nothing to
necessitate us believing in an immense age for these remains.
This is not to be considered a point against them, for there is
no reason for supposing that the mastodon may not have lingered
on to comparatively recent times, and that comparatively recent
men may not have intercepted and destroyed helpless individuals.
Indeed, we are told there are traditions still extant among the
Indians of these monsters.<a href="#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have other facts showing that, in this
country as in Europe, man was certainly living not far from the
time when the land was covered with the ice of the Glacial Age,
whatever may be true of still earlier periods. We are told that,
when the time came for the final breaking up of the great
glaciers, and while they still lingered at the head waters of the
Platte, the Missouri, and the Yellowstone rivers, a mighty
lake&mdash;or, rather, a succession of lakes&mdash;occupied the
greater portion of the Missouri Valley. The rivers flowing into
them were of great size,<a href="#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a> and
heavily freighted with sediment, which was deposited in the still
waters of the lakes, and thus was formed the rich loess deposits
of Nebraska.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From several places in this loess have been
taken rude stone arrows, buried at such depths and under such
circumstances, that we must conclude they were deposited there
when the loess was forming. But this requires us to carry them
back to a time when elephants and mastodons roamed over the land,
for bones of these huge creatures<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> are quite frequently found. This
arrow-point &mdash;or, it may be, spear-head&mdash;was found
twenty feet from the surface; and almost directly above it, and
distant only thirteen inches, was a vertebra of an elephant. "It
appears, then, that some old races lived around the shores of
this lake, and, paddling over it, accidentally dropped their
arrows, or let them fly at a passing water-fowl;" and, from the
near presence of the elephant's bone, it is shown that man here,
as well as in Europe, was the contemporary of the elephant, in at
least a portion of the Missouri Valley.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<img alt="Implement found in Loess." src=
"images/Ch9_image/Implement.jpg" height="244" width="90" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">Other examples are on record. In Greene
County, Illinois, parties digging a well found, at the depth of
seventy-two feet, a stone hatchet. Mr. McAdams carefully examined
the well, to see if it could have dropped from near the surface.
He tells us the well was dug through loess deposits; and from the
top down was as smooth, and almost as hard, as a cemented
cistern.<a href="#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a> The loess was, as in
Nebraska, deposited in the still waters of the lake which once
occupied the Valley of the Illinois.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> And we need not doubt but that it
dates from the breaking up of the glacial ice. The position of
this hatchet, then, found at the very bottom of the loess
deposits, shows that, while yet the glaciers lingered in the
north, and the flooded rivers spread out in great lakes, some
tribes of stone-using folks hunted along the banks of the lakes,
whose bottoms were to form the rich prairies of the West.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Previous to this discovery, Mr. Foster had
recorded the finding in this same formation, distant but a few
miles, a rude hatchet. There was in this case a possibility that
the stone could have been shaped by natural means, and so he did
not affirm this to be a work of man; but he says, "had it been
recovered from a plowed field, I should have unhesitatingly said
it was an Indian's hatchet."<a href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> We
think it but another instance of relics found under such
circumstances, that it points to the presence of man at the close
of the Glacial Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No doubt many similar discoveries have been
made, but the specimens were regarded as the work of Indians; and
though the position in which they wore found may have excited
some surprise, they were not brought to the attention of the
scholars. Nor is it only in the prairie regions of the West where
such discoveries have been made. Col. C. C. Jones has recorded
the finding of some flint implements in the drift of the
Chattahooche River, which we think as conclusively proves the
presence of man in a far away time as do any of the discoveries
in the river gravels of Europe. It seems that gold exists in the
sands of this river, and the early settlers were quick to take
advantage of it. They dug canals in places to turn the river from
its present channel&mdash;and others, to reach some buried
channel of former times. These sections passed down to the hard
slate rock, passing through the surface, and the underlying
drift, composed of sand, gravel, and bowlders. "During one of
these excavations, at a depth of nine feet below the surface,
commingled with the gravels and bowlders of the drift, and just
above the rocky substratum upon which the deposit rested, were
found three [Paleolithic] flint implements."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He adds that, "in materials, manners of
construction, and in general appearance, so nearly do they
resemble some of the rough, so-called flint hatchets, belonging
to the drift type, as described by M. Boucher De Perthes, that
they might very readily be mistaken, the one for the other."
"They are as emphatically drift implements, as any that have
appeared in the diluvial matrix of France." On the surface soil,
above the flints, are found the ordinary relics of the Indians.
The works of the Mound Builders are also to be seen. Judging from
their position, the Paleolithics must be greatly older than any
of the surface remains. Many centuries must go by to account for
the formation of the vegetable soil above them.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Speculating on their age, Mr. Jones eloquently
says, "If we are ignorant of the time when the Chattahooche first
sought a highway to the Gulf; if we know not the age of the
artificial tumuli which still grace its banks; if we are
uncertain when the red Nomads who, in fear and wonder, carried
the burdens of the adventurous DeSoto, as he conducted his
followers through primeval forests, and, by the sides of their
softly mingling streams, first became dwellers here, how shall we
answer the question as to the age in which these rude drift
implements were fashioned and used by these primitive people?"<a
href="#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The examples we have quoted, even though the
case of California be not considered, are all suggestive of a
great antiquity for man, taking us back in time to when the
glaciers still "shone in frigid splendor" over the northern part
of the United States. When European savants had established the
science of Arch&aelig;ology, and shown the existence of separate
stages of culture, it was but natural that those interested in
the matter on this side of the Atlantic should turn with renewed
energy to investigate the arch&aelig;ology of this country, to
see if here, too, they could find evidence of a Paleolithic Age.
But the scholar in this country is confronted with a peculiar
difficulty. Owing to the very multiplicity and variety of relics
of prehistoric times, it is difficult to properly classify and
understand them. The field is of great extent, the time of study
has been short, and the explorers few; so it is not strange that
but few localities have been thoroughly searched. But, until this
is done, we can not hope to reach definite conclusions.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The peculiar culture of the Indians,
prevailing among them at the time of the discovery, proved a
hindrance, rather than a help, in this matter. The Indians are
certainly not Paleolithic, many of their implements being finely
wrought and polished; but their arrow-heads, hatchets, and celts
were sufficiently rude to spread the conviction that all weapons
and implements of stone should be referred to them. This belief
has done much to hinder real progress. It is not to be wondered
at that some difference of opinion has prevailed, among our
scholars, whether the different stages of culture, discovered in
Europe, have any existence here.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On one hand, it is denied that different
stages can be detected. Says Prof. Whitney: "It is evident that
there has been no unfolding of the intellectual faculties of the
human race on this continent similar to that which has taken
place in Central Europe. We can recognize no Paleolithic,
Neolithic, Bronze, or Iron Ages."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a> Others assure us, that if present, the
ages stand in reverse order. "The relics last used were by far
the rudest, and the historic races, which are the survivors of
the prehistoric, are the wildest of the two; the lower status
remaining, while the higher has passed away."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a> In still another place we read: "The
Neolithic and Bronze Ages preceded the Paleolithic, at least in
the Mississippi basin."<a href="#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding these quotations, we think it
will yet be shown that in this country, as in Europe, there was a
true Paleolithic Age, and that there was no such inversion as is
here spoken of. In some places sedentary tribes may have been
driven away and their territory occupied by more war-like, but
less highly cultivated tribes. But take the whole Indian race,
and they were steadily advancing through the Neolithic stage of
culture. They were acquainted with copper, and were drawing near
to the discovery of bronze and metals, and, indeed, the discovery
had been made of bronze in the far south. But lying back of the
true Indian Age, long preceding it in time, to which probably
belong the relics mentioned in the preceding discoveries, is a
true Paleolithic Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are indebted for the facts on which the
above conclusion rests more to the writings of Dr. C. C. Abbott,
of Trenton, New Jersey, than any other individual, and his
results are based on an extensive study of the relics themselves
and the position in which found. In a collection of stone
implements of this country arranged in a cabinet, we find rude
and unpolished specimens, as well as those of a finely wrought
Neolithic type. Now the Indians, when first discovered,
frequently made use of very rudely formed implements, and from a
knowledge of this fact, it came about that but little attention
was paid to the position in which the relics were discovered.
They were all classified as Indian relics. But the greatest and
most valuable discoveries in science have occurred as a result of
the attention paid to little things; in this case by carefully
scrutinizing the position in which they occurred.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Abbott commenced by gathering a very
extensive collection, carefully searching his section of country
and gathering all specimens of artificially shaped stones. These
must have existed there in considerable quantities, as, in three
years' time, he collected over nine thousand specimens,<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>49</sup></a> carefully examining them as they came
from the soil.<a href="#Refer"><sup>50</sup></a> As a result of
this extensive and careful research he is able to present us some
general conclusions. The surface specimens, including in this
classification also those specimens turned up by the plow,<a
href="#Refer"><sup>51</sup></a> are characteristically Indian.
The material is jasper and quartz, and they are generally
carefully made. They used other varieties of stone as well. Like
the Neolithic people of Europe, they sought the best varieties of
stone for their purpose. But his collection also included rude
Paleolithic forms, and he found by taking the history of each
specimen separately, that just in proportion as the relics were
rude in manufacture and primitive in type the deeper were they
buried in the soil.<a href="#Refer"><sup>52</sup></a> Writing in
1875, he says: "We have never met a jasper (flint) arrow-head in
or below an undisturbed stratum of sand or gravel, and we have
seldom met with a rude implement of the general character of
European drift implements on the surface of the ground."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These are not theoretical opinions, but are
deductions drawn from a very extensive experience. From figured
specimens of these rudest formed implements, we see they are
veritable Paleolithic forms, resembling in a remarkable manner
the rude implements of the old world, whether collected in France
or in India. We learned that the Paleolithic people of Europe
utilized the easiest attainable stone for their implements. They
contented themselves with such pieces of flint as they could
gather in their immediate vicinity. The easiest attainable rock
in the valley of the Delaware is not flint, but argillite, and
such is the material of which the Paleolithic implements are
formed. Thus it is shown that the first appearance of a
stone-using folk in the valley of the Delaware was in the
Paleolithic stage of their culture. Judging from the depths of
their buried implements, this long preceded the Neolithic
stage.</p>

<img alt="Spear-shaped Paleolithic Implement." src=
"images/Ch9_image/Spear_shape.jpg" height="318" width="228" align=
"RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">These conclusions have been sustained in a
very marked manner by late discoveries in the valley of the
Delaware, to which we will now refer. After reaching the
conclusion that the relics of the Stone Age in New Jersey clearly
pointed to a Paleolithic beginning, when argillite, the most
easily attainable stone, was utilized in the manufacture of
weapons and implements, Dr. Abbott made the further discovery
that in the ancient gravels of the Delaware River Paleolithic
implements only were to be found. We must remember that it was in
the gravels of European rivers that the first discoveries were
made which have since resulted in so wonderfully extending our
knowledge of the past of man.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The city of Trenton, New Jersey, is built on a
gravel terrace whose surface is between forty and fifty feet
above the flood plain of the Delaware. We are told that this
gravel is clearly a river deposit, and must have been laid down
by the Delaware at some former time in its history. It is in this
gravel deposit that quite a large number of Paleolithic
implements have been found.</p>

<img alt="Paleolithic Implement, Argillite." src=
"images/Ch9_image/Argilite.jpg" height="330" width="165" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">This cut is a representation of one of them,
found under such circumstances that there can be no question
about its antiquity. We are told it was taken from the face of
the bluff fronting the river. Owing to heavy rains, a large
section off of the front of the bluff became detached just the
day before this specimen was discovered. It was found in the
fresh surface thus exposed, twenty-one feet from the surface,
almost at the bottom of the gravel. Immediately above it, and in
contact with it, was a bowlder estimated to weigh over one
hundred pounds. Immediately above this last was a second and much
larger bowlder. It is manifest the implements could never have
gotten in the place found after the gravel had been deposited.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This is only one of the many examples that
could be given. But it is to be noticed that implements of the
Neolithic type do not occur in the gravel, except on the surface.
Dr. Abbott is not the only one who has found those implements.
Many of our best American scholars have visited the locality and
secured specimens, amongst others, Prof. Boyd Dawkins, of
England, who is so familiar with this class of relics in Europe.
We may consider it proven, then, that in this country there was
also a Paleolithic Age. Our present information in regard to it
is only a beginning.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Since this interesting discovery was made in
New Jersey we have received news of similar discoveries in
Minnesota. A lady, Miss Frank Babbitt, has found in the modified
drift of the Mississippi River, at Little Falls, Minnesota,
evidence of the existence of Paleolithic man. The implements are
made of quartz, and not argillite, but closely resemble
implements made of this later material as described by Dr.
Abbott. It is, to say the least, an interesting coincidence that
one of a very few flint implements found in the Trenton gravel by
Dr. Abbott should be identical in shape with some of the flint
implements in Minnesota.<a href="#Refer"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This point being determined, others at once
spring up asking solution. Among the very first is the question
of age. The river terrace on which Trenton is built is a
geological formation, and if we can determine its age we shall
also determine at least one point in the antiquity of man, for we
know the implements are as old as the gravels. It is not
necessary for our purpose to give more than the results of the
careful labors of others in this direction. We may be sure that
this question has been carefully studied. When the implements
were first discovered, the gravels were considered of glacial
origin, and to that period they were assigned by Dr. Abbott.
Subsequently Prof. Lewis, a member of the Pennsylvania State
survey, decided that they were essentially
post-glacial&mdash;that is, more recent in time than the Glacial
Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>56</sup></a> Still more recently Prof.
Wright, of Oberlin, but also of the State survey of Pennsylvania,
concludes that they are, after all, a deposit made at the very
close of the Glacial Age.<a href="#Refer"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He thinks the sequence of events were about as
follows: When the ice of the Glacial Age reached its greatest
development, and came to a pause in its southward march, it
extended in an unbroken wall across the northern part of New
Jersey, crossing the Delaware about sixty-five miles above
Trenton. In front of it was accumulated the great terminal
morain&mdash;a long range of gravelly hills still marking its
former presence.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is certain that the close of the Glacial
Age was comparatively sudden, and marked by floods far exceeding
any thing we are acquainted with at the present day. For, when
the formation of the ice ceased, we must bear in mind that the
country to the north of the terminal morain was covered with a
great glacier, in some places exceeding a mile in thickness. When
glacial conditions were passing away, and the ice commenced to
melt faster than it was produced, the thaw would naturally go on
over the entire field at an increasing rate, and hence would
result floods in all the rivers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">He considers the gravels in question to have
been deposited near the close of this flooded period, when the
land stood at about its present level and the glaciers had
retreated perhaps to the Catskill Mountains. The rivers were
still swollen and would be heavily charged with coarse gravel
brought from the morains and lying exposed on the surface of the
ground vacated by the glaciers.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Probably but few geologists will take
exceptions to these views. Thus we have very satisfactory reasons
for connecting these Paleolithic people with the close of the
Glacial Age&mdash;a conclusion to which the scattering
discoveries mentioned in the preceding pages also points. But as
regards Dr. Abbott's discoveries, they are on such a scale, and
vouched for by so many eminent observers, that we need no longer
hesitate to accept them, or complain of the scattering nature of
the finds.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But we might inquire whether this is the
earliest period to which the presence of man can be ascribed in
this country? Excepting, of course, California, we do not know of
any well established fact on which to base a greater antiquity
for man. However, this subject is very far from being as closely
studied as in Europe. Believing that in Europe man was living
before the Glacial Age, and that in all probability he was living
in California at the same early time, we would naturally expect
to find some evidence of his presence in the Mississippi Basin
and along the Atlantic seaboard. But no explorer has yet been
fortunate enough to make such discoveries.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is scarcely necessary to point out that we
have only the relative age of these gravel deposits. We have not
yet arrived at an answer in years. This we are not able to do. As
we have several times remarked, our American scholars, as a rule,
do not think many thousands of years have elapsed since the
Glacial Age, and yet they are not all agreed on that point. From
the depths in the gravel and loess deposits that the stone relics
are found, we may suppose that man was present during the entire
series of years their formation represents. Prof. Aughey, to
whose discoveries in loess deposits in Nebraska we have referred,
estimates the length of time necessary to produce those deposits
as between nineteen and twenty thousand years, and this he
considers a low estimate. So we see that, at any rate, the date
of man's first appearance in America was certainly very far in
the past.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In forming a mental picture of the conditions
of life at that early time, it is not necessary to imagine a
dreary scene of Arctic sterility. This is not true of the time
when the Glacial Age was at its greatest severity. But at the
time we are now considering, the glaciers had retreated over a
large part of the country, though they still lingered in northern
and mountainous regions. Great lakes and majestic rivers were the
features of the country. The St. Lawrence was still choked with
ice, and the great lakes must have discharged their waters
southward.<a href="#Refer"><sup>60</sup></a> The Mississippi,
gathering in one mighty stream the drainage of the Central Basin,
sped onward to the Gulf, doubtless many times larger than its
present representative. The animals then living included several
species that have since become extinct. Mastodons and elephants
must have been numerous, as their remains are frequently found in
loess deposits.<a href="#Refer"><sup>61</sup></a> They have also
been found in the gravels of New Jersey, in connection with the
rude implements already mentioned. Probably keeping close to the
retreating glaciers were such animals as the moose, reindeer, and
musk-ox, while the walrus disported itself in the waters off the
coast. At any rate those animals now only found in high northern
latitudes were living during Glacial times as far south as
Kentucky and New Jersey.<a href="#Refer"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A good deal of interest is connected with the
finding of one mastodon's tooth. It was found in the gravel
deposit, about fourteen feet beneath the surface. It must have
been washed to the position where found when the great floods
from the melting glacier, with their burden of sand and gravel,
were rolling down the valley. We can either conclude that the
climate was such as to permit the existence of such animals, or
that the animal to which it belonged lived in some far away
pre-glacial time. But our interest suddenly increases when we
learn that, but a few feet away, under exactly similar
circumstances, was found the wisdom tooth of a human being. It,
too, was rolled, scratched, and polished, and had evidently been
swept along by the tumultuous flood. "The same agency that
brought the one from the Upper Valley of the Delaware brought the
other, and, after long years, they come again to light, and
jointly testify that, in that undetermined long ago, the
creatures to which they respectively belonged were living
together in the valley of the river."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now consider the question of race. Who
were the men that fashioned the implements? Were they Indians? or
were they a different people? As far as we know the Indians, they
were Neolithic. Their implements and weapons are often polished,
pecked, and finely wrought; and, as before remarked, they
employed the best kind of stone for their purpose. Dr. Abbott,
who speaks from a very extensive personal experience, tells us,
that it is not practical to trace any connection between the
well-known Indian forms and the Paleolithic implements of the
river gravels: "The wide gap that exists between a full series of
each of the two forms is readily recognized when the two are
brought together."<a href="#Refer"><sup>64</sup></a> Besides this
difference in form, there is also a difference in material. The
ruder forms not being of jasper and allied minerals, but are
almost exclusively of argillite.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>65</sup></a> In addition to the foregoing, we must
consider the different positions they occupy&mdash;the former
being found only on or near the surface, the latter deeply buried
within. These different reasons all point to the same conclusion:
that is, that the Indians were preceded in this country by some
other people, who manufactured the Paleolithic specimens recently
discovered.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Europe, Prof. Dawkins, as we have seen,
maintains that the Cave-men were the predecessors of the Eskimos.
This may serve us as a point of departure in the inquiry as to
who the pre-Indian people were? It is manifest, however, that we
must have some ground on which to base this theory. The Eskimo
seem to belong to the Arctic region, as naturally as the white
bear and the walrus. At the early time we are considering in
America, glaciers had not retreated very far. So his climatic
surroundings must have been much the same as at present. But the
Eskimo may not live where he does now by choice: we may behold in
him a people driven from a fairer heritage, who found the
ice-fields of the North more endurable than the savage enemy who
envied him his possession. It seems very reasonable to suppose
that the Eskimos long inhabited this country before the arrival
of the Indians, if it was not, in fact, their original home.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mention has been made of the Eskimo traits
still to be observed among the tribes of California. Prof. Putnam
thinks that this fact can best be explained on the supposition
that these tribes came in contact with primitive Eskimo people.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>66</sup></a> Dr. Rink, from investigation of
the language and traditions of the different Eskimo tribes,
thinks they are of American origin, and must once have lived much
farther south.<a href="#Refer"><sup>67</sup></a> He says, "The
Eskimos appear to have been the last wave of an aboriginal
American race, which has spread over the continent from more
genial regions&mdash; following principally the rivers and
water-courses, and continually yielding to the pressure of the
tribes behind them until they have at last peopled the
sea-coasts."<a href="#Refer"><sup>68</sup></a> Mr. Dall, in his
explorations of the Aleutian Islands, comes to the same
conclusion as Dr. Rink. He says his own conclusions are, "that
the Eskimos were once inhabitants of the interior of North
America&mdash;have much the same distribution as the walrus,
namely, as far south as New Jersey."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">All this tends to prove that the Paleolithic
people of New Jersey were ancestors of the Eskimos. This becomes
highly probable when we pursue the subject a little farther. Dr.
Abbott has shown, from the similarity of implements, position in
which found, and so forth, that the Paleolithic people continued
to occupy the country down to comparatively recent times, when
Indian relics took their place.<a href="#Refer"><sup>70</sup></a>
This is such an important point that we must give his reasons
more in detail. Remember that Dr. Abbott speaks from the
experience gained by gathering over twenty thousand specimens of
stone implements, and paying especial attention to the position
in which they were found. The surface soil of that section of New
Jersey, where he made his explorations, was formed by the slow
decomposition of vegetable and forest growth. In this layer he
found great numbers of undoubted Indian implements. The number,
however, rapidly decreases the deeper we go in this stratum. This
would show that the Indians were late arrivals. Below this
surface soil is a stratum of sand, overlying the gravelly beds
below and passing into the surface soil just mentioned. In this
layer were found great numbers of implements inferior to the
Indian types found on the surface, but superior to the
Paleolithic specimens described. They are not only inferior in
finish to the Indian specimens, but are of different material.
They are always formed of argillite. It was further noticed that
the number of these rapidly decreased in the layer of surface
soil, and are but rarely found on the surface.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now it might be said that these rude forms
were fashioned by Indians when in a rude state of culture, and,
as they became more advanced, they learned the superior qualities
of flint, and so dropped the use of argillite. But it so happens
that we have found several places where were veritable
manufactories of Indian implements. It is very significant that
we never find one where the workman used both flint and
argillite. He always used flint alone. Every thing seems to point
to the fact, that the tribes who fashioned the argillite
implements were different from the Indian tribes who made the
flint implements. It is Dr. Abbott's conclusions that the former,
the descendants of the Paleolithic tribes, were the Eskimos, who,
according to these views, must have inhabited the eastern portion
of the United States to comparatively recent times.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In further support of these views, we think we
have grounds for asserting that we have veritable historical
accounts of the Eskimo people slowly retiring before the
aggressions of their Indian foes. It is no longer doubted but
that Norsemen, as early as the year 1000, made voyages of
discovery along the coast of North America, as far south as Rhode
Island: they called the country Vineland. It is true that the
Icelandic accounts of these expeditions contain some foolish and
improbable statements; but so do the writings of Cotton Mather,
made many years later.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These accounts refer but very briefly to the
inhabitants they saw, but enough is given to show that the people
were not Indians, but Eskimos. The language used is: "The men
were small of stature and fierce, having a bushy head of hair,
and very great eyes, and wide cheeks."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>71</sup></a> Their small size is frequently
referred to, which would surely not be the case if they were
describing the Algonkins that the English colonists found in the
same section of country many years later. To the same effect is
the assertion that the Eskimos did not reach Greenland until the
middle of the fourteenth century.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>72</sup></a> The traditions of the Tuscarawas
Indians that place their arrival on the Atlantic coast in the
year 1300, also refer to a tribe of people that were at least
much like the Eskimos.<a href="#Refer"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus we are led, step by step, to the
recognition of a Paleolithic Age in America, and finally to the
belief that the descendants of these people were Eskimos. We at
once notice the coincidence of these results with some of the
conclusions of Prof. Dawkins, of England, and it is desirable to
trace a little farther the points of resemblance and difference
between this age in America and in Europe. In this latter country
we have seen the Paleolithic Age can be divided into two stages,
or epochs, during which different races inhabited the country.
The first, or the epoch of the men of the River Drift, long
preceded the epoch of the Cave-men. It was those latter tribes
only that Mr. Dawkins connects with the Eskimos.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have not yet found evidence in this country
that points to such a division of the Paleolithic Age. We have no
relics of Cave-men as distinguished from the men of the River
Drift. It is true, we are not lacking evidence of the use of
caves by various tribes,<a href="#Refer"><sup>74</sup></a> but
there is nothing to show that such use was very ancient, or that
the people were properly Paleolithic. We can not say what future
discoveries will unfold, but as yet we have only implements of
the River Drift type, and these are the men Dr. Abbott considers
to be the ancestors of the Eskimos. In this country, then, we
have shown the existence of but one race of men in the same stage
of culture as the men of the River Drift, but of the same race as
the men of the Cave. These results may be cited as an argument in
favor of those scholars who think that the men of the River Drift
and the men of the Cave were in reality the same people.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Europe there was apparently a long lapse of
time between the disappearance of the Paleolithic tribes and the
arrival of the Neolithic people, but we have no evidence of such
a period in America. The Paleolithic people remained in
possession until driven away by the Neolithic ones. All evidence
of Paleolithic man in Europe terminated with the Glacial Age, and
there is little doubt but what they date from preglacial times.
Our present knowledge does not carry us any farther back in this
country than the close of Glacial times. If we consider that the
Glacial Age in America coincides in time with the same age in
Europe, then the last statements would imply that the Paleolithic
Age here was later than in Europe; in fact, that Paleolithic man
had run his course in Europe before he appeared in America, and
some might even go further, and say that he migrated from Europe
to America. There are, however, no good grounds for such
conclusions. We believe that future discoveries will show that in
America also Paleolithic man was living in Glacial and preglacial
times.<a href="#Refer"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We feel that we have done but scant justice to
this subject, but we assure our readers that this question has
been but little studied in this country. Referring all relics of
stone to the Indians, our scholars have been slow to recognize
traces of an earlier race in America. Our sources of information
are as yet but few, and much remains to be done in this field. In
Europe as in America, scholars are still hard at work on the
Paleolithic Age, and we are to hold ourselves in readiness to
modify our opinions, or to reject them entirely and adopt new
ones as our knowledge increases.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is one thought that occurs to us. From
the combined investigations of both European and American
scholars, the Eskimo is seen to be one of the oldest (if not the
oldest) races of men now living. They afford a striking
illustration of the fact that a race may early reach a limit of
culture beyond which, as a race, they can not pass. Should the
American discoveries establish the fact that the River Drift
tribes are also Eskimos, then we are fairly entitled to consider
them the remnant of a people who once held possession of all the
globe, but who have been driven to the inhospitable regions of
the North by the pressure of later people. What changes have come
over the earth since that early time? In the long lapse of years
that have gone by newer races, advancing by slow degrees, have at
last achieved civilization. The fiat of Omnipotent power could
have created the world in a perfected form for the use of man,
but instead of so doing, Infinite Wisdom allowed slow-acting
causes, working through infinite years, to develop the globe from
a nebulous mass. Man could, indeed, have been created a civilized
being, but instead of this, his starting-point was certainly very
low. He was granted capacities in virtue of which he has risen.
We are not to say what the end shall be, but we think it yet far
off.</p>
