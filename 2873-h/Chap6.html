"190" width="100" align="LEFT"> THE preceding chapters we have
sought to learn what we could of the Paleolithic Age. We have
seen what strange people and animals occupied the land, and have
caught some glimpses of a past that has been recovered to us out
of the very night of time. From under the ashes of Vesuvius
arch&aelig;ologists have brought to light an ancient city. We
gaze on it with great interest, for we there see illustrated the
state of society two thousand years ago. But other cities of that
time are still in existence, and not only by the aid of tradition
and song, but from the pages of history, we can learn of the
civilization of the Roman people at the time of the destruction
of Pompei; so that, in this case, our knowledge of the past is
not confined to one source of information. But no voice of
history or tradition, or of existing institutions, speaks to us
of the Paleolithic Age. Of that remote time, the morning time of
human life, we learn only from the labors of geologists and
arch&aelig;ologists. We are virtually dealing with a past
geological age. The long term of years thus defined drew to its
close amidst scenes of almost Arctic sterility. In all
probability, glaciers reflected the sun's rays from all the
considerable hills and mountains of Central and Northern Europe,
though forming, perhaps, but a remnant of the great glaciers of
the Ice Age. The neighboring seas must have been whitened by the
glistening sails of numerous icebergs. Such was the closing scene
of Paleolithic life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The first great cycle of human life, as far as
we know it now, was concluded in Europe. We do not mean to say
that it terminated all over the world. In other regions it
survived to far later times. But, in Europe, Paleolithic animals
and men had worked out their mission, and we have now to record
the arrival and spread of a new race, bringing with them domestic
animals, a knowledge of rude husbandry, and many simple arts and
industries of which their Paleolithic predecessors were
ignorant.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We recall, that the men of the Paleolithic Age
seemed incapable of advancement;<a href="#Refer"><sup>2</sup></a>
or their progress was so slow that we scarcely notice it. But we
can trace the lines of advancement from the Neolithic culture to
that of the present. We have, however, to deal with people and
times far removed from the light of history.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have before us, then, a new culture and a
new people. On the one hand is Paleolithic man, with his rude
stone implements, merely chipped into shape&mdash;surrounded by
many animals which have since vanished from the theater of
life&mdash;inhabiting a country which, at its close at least, was
more like Greenland of to-day than England or France. The scene
completely changes, when the misty curtain of the past again
rises and allows us to continue our investigations into primitive
times.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We would naturally expect to find everywhere,
connecting links between these two ages&mdash;the culture of the
one gradually changing into the culture of the other. This,
however, is not the case. The line of demarkation between the
ages is everywhere plainly drawn; and, furthermore, we are
learning that a very long time elapsed between the departure, or
disappearance, of the Paleolithic tribes, and the arrival of
their Neolithic successors. This is shown in a great many ways,
and we will notice some of them. We learn that Neolithic man
occasionally used caves as a place of habitation. In such cases
there is nearly always a thick layer of stalagmite between the
strata containing the Paleolithic implements and the Neolithic
strata &mdash;though this stalagmite is unmistakable evidence of
the lapse of many years, we can not determine how many, as we do
not know the rate of formation.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This lapse of time is shown very plainly when
we come to consider the changes wrought in the surface features
of the country by the action of running water. We know that rain,
running water, and frost, constituting what we call denuding
forces, are constantly at work changing the surface of a country.
We know that, in general, this change is slow. But great changes
have been wrought between these two ages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the British Islands, we know that the
rivers had time to very materially change the surface features of
the land. The important rivers of Scotland had carved out
channels one hundred feet deep in places; and along their
courses, especially near their mouths, had plowed out and removed
great quantities of glacial material&mdash;forming broad flats
which became densely wooded before Neolithic man made his
appearance on the scene. In some cases the entire surface of the
land had been removed, leaving only knolls and hills of the old
land surface. Examples of this occur on the east coast of
England, and in what is known as the Fen-lands. The final retreat
of the glaciers must have left the country covered with
<i>d&eacute;bris.</i> After this had been largely denuded, the
country became densely wooded. It was not until these changes had
taken place, that Neolithic man wandered into Europe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But still another ground exists for claiming a
long interval between these two ages, namely, the great changes
that took place in the animal world of Europe during these two
epochs. Many different species of animals characteristic of the
Paleolithic Age vanished as completely from Europe as the rude
tribes that hunted them, before the appearance of Neolithic
tribes. But little change in the fauna of England has taken place
in the last two thousand years. So it is obvious that the great
change above-mentioned demands many centuries for its
accomplishment. Huge animals of the elephant kind, such as the
mammoth, no longer crashed through the underbrush, or wallowed in
the lakes. The roars of lions and tigers, that haunted the caves
of early Europe, were no longer heard.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>4</sup></a> In short, there had disappeared forever
from Europe the distinctly southern animals that diversified the
fauna of Paleolithic times. Even the Arctic animals were banished
to northern latitudes, or mountain heights.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have dwelt to some length on the proofs of
a long-extended time between these two ages. The more we reflect
on these instances the more impressed are we with a sense of
duration vast and profound, in which the great forests and grassy
plains of Europe supported herds of wild animals all unvexed by
the presence of man. We will only mention one more point and then
pass on.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that the highest rank we can
assign to Paleolithic man in the scale of civilization is Upper
Savagism. But when Neolithic man appeared, he was in the middle
status of Barbarism. The time, therefore, between the
disappearance of Paleolithic man and the arrival of Neolithic man
was long enough to enable primitive man to pass one entire
ethnical period, that of Lower Barbarism. But this requires a
very long period of time, probably several times as long as the
entire series of years since Civilization first appeared, which
is supposed to be in the neighborhood of five thousand years
ago.<a href="#Refer"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now turn our attention to Neolithic
man himself and learn what we can of his culture, and discover,
if possible, what race it was that spread over Europe after it
had been for so long a time an uninhabitable country. A few
remarks by way of introduction will not be considered amiss.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are learning that tribal organization,
implying communism in living, is characteristic of prehistoric
people.<a href="#Refer"><sup>6</sup></a> Tribal organization
sufficed to advance man to the very confines of civilization. We
have no doubt but that this was the state of society amongst the
Neolithic people. But this implies living in communities or
villages. We need not picture to ourselves a country dotted with
houses, the abodes of single families; such did not exist, but
here and there were fortified villages.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Still another consequence follows from this
tribal state of society. There was no such thing as a strong
central government. Each tribe obeyed its own chief, and a state
of war nearly always existed between different tribes. Such we
know was the state of things among the Indian tribes of America.
Travelers tell us that it is so to-day in Africa. Each tribe
stood ready to defend itself or to make war on its neighbors. One
great point, therefore, in constructing a village, was to secure
a place that could be easily defended.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Bearing these principles in mind, let us see
what we can learn of their habitations. Owing to a protracted
drouth, the water in the Swiss lakes was unusually low in the
Winter of 1854, and the inhabitants of Meilen, on the Lake
Z&uuml;rich, took advantage of this state of affairs to throw up
embankments some distance out from the old shore, and thus gain a
strip of land along the coast. In carrying out this design, they
found in the mud at the bottom of the lake a number of piles,
some thrown down and others upright, fragments of rough pottery,
bone and stone instruments, and various other relics.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Keller, president of the Z&uuml;rich
Antiquarian Society, was apprised of this discovery, and
proceeded at once to examine the collection made and the place of
discovery. He was not long in determining the prehistoric nature
of the relics, and the true intent of the pile remains. He proved
them to be supports for platforms, on which were erected rude
dwellings, the platforms being above the surface of the water,
and at some distance from the shore, with which they were
connected by a narrow bridge.</p>

<center><img alt="Lake Village, Switzerland." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Swiss_village.jpg" height="449" width="640"></center>

<br>
 

<p align="JUSTIFY">This was the first of a series of many
interesting discoveries from which we have learned many facts as
to Neolithic, times. The out we have introduced is an ideal
restoration of one of these Swiss lake villages. It needs but a
glance to show how admirably placed it was for purposes of
defense. Unless an enemy was provided with boats, the only way of
approach was over the bridge. But the very fact that they
resorted to lakes, where at the expense of great labor they
erected their villages, is a striking illustration of the
insecurity of the times.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This discovery once made, it is surprising
what numbers of these ancient lake villages have been discovered.
Switzerland abounds in large and small lakes, and in former times
they must have been still more numerous, but in the course of
years they have become filled up, and now exist only as peat
bogs. But we now know that during the Neolithic Age the country
was quite thickly inhabited, and these lakes were the sites of
villages. Over two hundred have been found in Switzerland alone.
Fishermen had known of the existence of these piles long before
their meaning was understood. Lake Geneva is one of the most
famous of the Swiss lakes. Though in the main it is deep, yet
around the shore there is a fringe of shallow water.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It was in this shallow belt that the villages
were built. The sites of twenty-four settlements are known. We
are told that on "calm days, when the surface of the water is
unruffled, the piles are plainly visible. Few of them now project
more than two feet from the bottom, eaten away by the incessant
action of the water. Lying among them are objects of bone, horn,
pottery, and frequently even of bronze. So fresh are they, and so
unaltered, they look as if they were only things of yesterday,
and it seems hard to believe that they can have remained there
for centuries."<a href="#Refer"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A lake settlement represents an immense amount
of work for a people destitute of metallic tools. After settling
on the locality, the first step would be to obtain the timbers.
The piles were generally composed of the trunks of small-sized
trees at that time flourishing in Switzerland. But to cut down a
tree with a stone hatchet is no slight undertaking. They probably
used fire to help them. After the tree was felled it had to be
cut off again at the right length, the branches lopped off, and
one end rudely sharpened. It was then taken to the place and
driven into the mud of the lake bottom. For this purpose they
used heavy wooden mallets. It has been estimated that one of the
settlements on Lake Constance required forty thousand piles in
its construction.<a href="#Refer"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The platform which rested on these piles was
elevated several feet above the surface of the water, so as to
allow for the swash of the waves. It was composed of branches and
trunks of trees banded together, the whole covered with clay.
Sometimes they split the trees with wedges so as to make thick
slabs. In some instances wooden pegs were used to fasten portions
of the platform to the pilework.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As to the houses which were erected on these
platforms, though they have utterly vanished, yet from a few
remains we can judge something as to the mode of construction.
They seem to have been formed of trunks of trees placed upright,
one by the side of the other, and bound together by interwoven
branches. This was then covered on both sides with two or three
inches of clay. A plaster of clay and gravel formed the floor,
and a few slabs of sandstone did duty for a fire-place. The roof
was of bark, straw, or rushes. There does not seem to have been
much of a plan used in laying out a settlement. As population
increased other piles were added, and thus the village gradually
extended. No one village would be likely to contain a great
number of inhabitants. Calculations based on the area of one of
the largest settlements in Lake Geneva, gives as a result a
population of thirteen hundred, but manifestly nothing definite
is known.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This brief description gives us an idea of a
method of constructing villages which, as we shall soon see,
extended all over Europe, though varied somewhat in detail. The
condition of the remains indicate that these settlements were
often destroyed by fire. At such times quantities of arms,
implements, and household industries would have been lost in the
water, and so preserved for our inspection.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This mode of building found such favor among
the early inhabitants of Europe that it continued in use through
the Neolithic Age, that of Bronze, and even into the age of Iron.
Passages here and there in ancient histories evidently refer to
them. Though they have long since passed away in Switzerland, the
Spaniards found them in Mexico, and they are still to be seen in
some of the isles of the Pacific. Remembering this, we need not
be surprised if we find in one small lake settlements belonging
to widely different ages. Here one of the Stone Age, there one of
the Bronze, or even a confused mingling of what seems to be
several ages in one settlement.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There is scarcely a country in Europe that
does not contain examples of lake villages. From their wide
distribution we infer that a common race spread over the land. We
will now mention some differences in construction discovered at
some places, where, from the rocky nature of the bed of the lake,
it was impossible to drive piles so as to form a firm foundation.
They sometimes packed quantities of stone around the piles to
serve as supports in a manner as here indicated. "In all
probability the stones used were conveyed to the required spot by
means of canoes, made of hollowed out trunks of trees. Several of
these canoes may still be seen at the bottom of Lake Bienne, and
one, indeed, laden with pebbles, which leads us to think it must
have foundered with its cargo."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Foundation, Lake Village." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Foundation.jpg" height="119" width="360"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In some cases these heaps of stone and sticks
rise to the surface of the water or even above it, the piles in
such cases serving more to hold the mass together than as a
support to the platform on which the huts were erected. This mode
of construction could only be employed in small lakes. This makes
in reality an artificial island, and seems to have been the
favorite method of procedure in the British Islands. In Ireland
and Scotland immense numbers of these structures are known. They
are called crannogs. This cut represents a section of one in
Ireland. Though they date back to the Neolithic Age, yet they so
exactly meet the wants of a rude people that they were occupied
down to historic times.</p>

<center><img alt="Irish Crannog." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Irish_crannog.jpg" height="106" width="348"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The advantage of forming settlements where
they could only be approached on one side were so great that
other places than lakes were resorted to. Peat-bogs furnished
nearly as secure a place of retreat as do lakes. These have been
well studied in Northern Italy. They do not present many new
features. They were constructed like the lake villages, only they
were surrounded by a marsh, and not by a lake. In some of the
Irish bogs they first covered the surface of the bog with a layer
of hazel bushes, and that by a layer of sand, and thus secured a
firm surface.<a href="#Refer"><sup>11</sup></a> In this case the
villages were still further defended by a breastwork of rough
spars, about five feet high. One of the houses of this group was
found still in position, though it had been completely buried in
peat. No metal had been used in its construction. The timbers had
been cut with a stone ax, and the explorer was even so fortunate
as to find an ax, which exactly fitted many of the cuts observed
on the timbers.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But we are not to suppose that lakes and bogs
afforded the only sites of villages. They are found scattered all
over the surface of the country, and, as we shall soon see, they
show the same painstaking care to secure strong, easily defended
positions. They have been generally spoken of as forts, to which
the inhabitants resorted only in times of danger. We think,
however, they were locations of villages, the customary places of
abode. For this is in strict accordance with what we find to be
the early condition of savage life in every part of the
world.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Traces of these settlements on the main-land
have been mostly obliterated by the cultivation of the soil
during the many years that have elapsed since their Neolithic
founders occupied them. In Switzerland the location of five of
these villages are known. In all instances they occupied places
very difficult of approach&mdash;generally precipitous sides on
all but one or two. On the accessible sides ramparts defended
them. The relics obtained are in all respects similar to those
from the lake villages.<a href="#Refer"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Fortified Camp, Cissbury." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Fortified_camp.jpg" height="286" width="370"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Fortified inclosures have been described in
Belgium. We are told, "They are generally established on points
overhanging valleys, on a mass of rocks forming a kind of
headland, which is united to the rest of the country by a narrow
neck of land. A wide ditch was dug across this narrow tongue of
land, and the whole camp was surrounded by a thick wall of stone,
simply piled one upon another, without either mortar or cement."
"One of these walls, when described, was ten feet thick, and the
same in height." These intrenched positions were so well chosen
that most of them continued to be occupied during the ages which
followed. The Romans occasionally utilized them for their camps.
Over the whole inclosure of these ancient camps worked flints and
remains of pottery have been found.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>13</sup></a> These fortified places have been well
studied in the south of England.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What is known as the South-Downs in Sussex is
a range of hills of a general height of seven hundred feet. This
section is about five miles wide and fifty miles long. Four
rivers flow through these downs to the sea. In olden times their
lower courses must have been deep inlets of the sea, thus
dividing those hills into five groups, each separated from the
other by a wide extent of water and marsh land. To the north of
these hills was a vast expanse of densely wooded country. It is
not strange, then, to find traces of numerous settlements among
these hills. As the surface soil is very thin, old embankments
can still be traced. The cut given is a representation of
Cissbury, one of the largest of these camps. It incloses nearly
sixty acres. The rampart varies according to the slope of the
hill. Where the ascent was at all easy it was made double.
Fortified camps are very numerous throughout the hill country.
They vary, of course, in size, but the situation was always well
chosen.<a href="#Refer"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As for the buildings themselves, or huts of
the Neolithic people, we know but little. They were probably
built much the same as the houses in the lake settlements. We
meet with some strange modifications in England. Frequently
within these ramparts we find circular pits or depressions in the
ground. They are regarded as vestiges of habitations, and they
must have been mainly under ground. "They occur singly and in
groups, and are carried down to a depth of from seven to ten feet
through the superficial gravel into the chalk, each pit, or
cluster of pits, having a circular shaft for an entrance. At the
bottom they vary from five to seven feet in diameter, and
gradually narrow to two and a half or three feet in diameter in
the upper part. The floors were of chalk, sometimes raised in the
center, and the roof had been formed of interlaced sticks, coated
with clay imperfectly burned."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the north of Scotland, instead of putting
them under ground, they built them on the natural surface, and
then built a mound over them all. In appearance this was scarcely
distinguishable from a mound, but on digging in we discover a
series of large chambers, built generally with stones of
considerable size, and converging toward the center, where an
opening appears to have been left for light and ventilation. In
some instances the mound was omitted, and we have simply a
cluster of joining huts, with dry, thick walls. These have been
appropriately named "Bee-hive Houses."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can form a very good idea of Neolithic
Europe from what we have learned as to their habitations. A
well-wooded country, abounding in lakes and marshes, quite
thickly settled, but by a savage people, divided into many
tribes, independent of and hostile to each other. The lakes were
fringed with their peculiar settlements; they are to be noticed
in the marshes, and on commanding heights are still others. The
people were largely hunters and fishers, but, as we shall soon
see, they practised a rude husbandry and had a few domestic
animals. Such was the condition of Europe long before the Greek
and Latin tribes lit the beacon fires of civilization in the
south.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is evident that the builders of the lake
settlements and the fortified villages were an intelligent and
industrious people, though their scale in civilization was yet
low. Their various implements of bone, horn, and stone display
considerable advance over the rude articles of the Drift.</p>

<center><img alt="Neolithic Axes." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Neolithic_axes.jpg" height="491" width="398"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the most important implements was the
ax. The Paleolithic hatchet, we remember, was rude, massive, and
only roughly chipped into shape, and was intended to be held in
the hand. The Neolithic ax was a much better made one, and was
furnished with a handle. They were enabled to accomplish a great
deal with such axes. "Before it, aided by fire, the trees of the
forest fell to make room for the tiller of the ground, and by its
sharp edge wood became useful for the manufacture of various
articles and implements indispensable for the advancement of
mankind in culture."<a href="#Refer"><sup>17</sup></a> These axes
vary in size and finish. As a general thing they are ground to a
sharp, smooth edge, but not always, nor were they always
furnished with a handle.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some axes are found with a hole bored in them,
through which to pass a handle. These perforated axes are found
in considerable numbers, and some have denied that they could be
produced without the aid of metal. It is almost self-evident that
the perforated axes are later in date than the solid ones, and
probably many of them are no earlier in time than the Age of
Metals. There is, however, nothing to show that all belong to so
late a time. Besides, experiments have amply shown that even the
hardest kind of flint can be drilled without the aid of metals.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Warlike implements are, of course, quite
common. Many of the axes found are probably war axes. Then
besides we have arrowheads, spears, and daggers. These are
considered to be "marvels of skill in flint chipping."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>19</sup></a> Stone was used for a great many other
purposes, such as scrapers, sling-stones, hammers, saws, and so
on. Flint was generally the kind of stone used. Our civilization
owes a great deal to this variety of stone. It is not only hard,
but its cleavage is such that it was of the greatest use to
primitive man. In a general way the Neolithic stone implements
are seen to be better adapted to the object in view than the
Paleolithic specimens. They are also generally polished.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Wood was largely used in their common
household implements. But it is only in exceptional cases that it
has been preserved to us. They have been recovered, however, in
peat-bogs and in the remains of lake settlements. These wooden
utensils consist of bowls, ladles, knives, tubs, etc. They used
fire to hollow them out, and the blows of the flint hatchet used
to remove the charred portions, are still to be observed in some
specimens.</p>

<center><img alt="Neolithic Weapons." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Neolithic_weapons.jpg" height="302" width=
"386"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Neolithic people had learned how to
manufacture pottery, though not of a very superior quality. It is
all hand-made: so the potter's wheel had not yet been introduced.
The material is clay mixed with gravel or pounded shells. Very
often they ornamented their clay vessels with lines and dots. The
bowls or jars were evidently suspended by cords, for the bottom
was made too rounding for them to stand erect. Besides, we find
the holes for the cords, and in some places handles.</p>

<center><img alt="Hafted Hatchet in Sheath, and Axe in Sheath."
src="images/Ch6_image/Hatchet_and_axe.jpg" height="278" width=
"385"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">No notice of Neolithic tools would be complete
without mentioning the use made of horn and bone. One peculiar
use for which they employed horn was as a socket for holding
other implements. Thus this figure shows us an ax in a socket of
horn. The middle of the socket is generally perforated with a
round or oval hole, intended to receive a handle of oak, birch,
or some other kind of wood adapted for such a use. The cut below
represents a hatchet of this kind. A number of these sockets have
been found, which were provided at the end opposite to the stone
hatchet with a strong and pointed tooth. These are boars' tusks,
firmly buried in the stag's horn. These instruments, therefore,
fulfilled double purposes: they cut or crushed with one end and
pierced with the other. Sockets are also found which are not only
provided with the boars' tusks, but are hollowed out at each end,
so as to hold two flint hatchets at once, as is seen in our next
figure. Chisels and gouges were also sometimes placed in bone
handles. Portions of horn probably at times did duty as hoes. We
give a representation of such an implement.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>20</sup></a> We must now seek some information as
to how the men of the Neolithic Age supported life.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the remains of fish at all the lake
settlements it is evident they formed no inconsiderable portion
of their food. Fishing nets and hooks have been discovered. They
were successful hunters as well. But the men of this age were no
longer dependent on the chase for a livelihood. We have mentioned
several times that they were acquainted with agriculture. This
implies a great advance over the primitive hunters of the early
Stone Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">On the shores of the lakes which furnished
them with a place of habitation they raised many of our present
species of grain. Owing to a cause of which we have already
spoken&mdash;that is, destruction of the lake settlements by
fire&mdash;the carbonized remains of these cereals have been
preserved to us. There were four varieties of wheat raised, none
exactly like our common wheat. In addition to this they raised
barley and millet, several varieties of each. Nor were the fruits
neglected. Apples and pears were dried and laid away for use in
the Winter. Seeds of the common berries were found in abundance,
showing that these primitive people were fully alive to their
value.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From this it follows that the Neolithic people
were not only tillers of the soil, but horticulturists as well.
According to Dr. Keller, the vegetable kingdom furnished their
principal supply of food. Hazelnuts, beechnuts, and chestnuts
were found in such quantities as to show they had been gathered
for use. Neither hemp, oats, nor rye were known. Not only do we
find the remains of the grains, fruits, seeds, etc., from which
the above conclusions are drawn, but, farther than this, pieces
of bread have been found in a carbonized state, and thus as
effectually preserved as the bread of a far later date found in
the ovens of Pompeii. According to Figuier, the peasant classes
of Tuscany now bake bread, after merely bruising the grain, by
pouring the batter on glowing stones and then covering it with
ashes. As this ancient prehistoric bread is of similar shape, it
was probably baked in an equally primitive fashion.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Aside from the natural interest we feel in
these evidences as to ancient industry, a study of the remains of
plants cultivated by the Neolithic people reveals to us two
curious and suggestive facts. It has been found that the wild
plants then growing in Switzerland are in all respects like the
wild plants now growing there. But the cultivated
plants&mdash;wheat, millet, etc.&mdash;differ from all existing
varieties, and invariably have smaller seeds or fruits.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>22</sup></a> This shows us that man has evidently
been able to effect considerable change by cultivation, in the
common grains, during the course of the many centuries which
separate the Neolithic times from our own age. But if this rate
of change be adopted as a measure of time, what shall we say is
to the antiquity demanded to explain the origin of cultivated
grain from the wild grasses of their first form?</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We learn, in the second place, that the
cultivated plants are all immigrants from the
south-east&mdash;their native home being in South-eastern Europe
and Asia Minor. We shall afterward see that this is true of the
domestic animals also. There can be but one explanation for this.
The ancient inhabitants of Europe must have come from that
direction, and brought with them the plants they had cultivated
in their eastern homes, and the animals they had reduced to their
service. The traces of agriculture thus found in Switzerland are
by no means confined to that country. In other countries of
Europe, such as England and France, we also find proofs that men
cultivated the earth. In localities where we do not find the
grain itself, we find their rude mills, or mealing stones, which
as plainly indicate a knowledge of the agricultural art as the
presence of the cereals themselves.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we have stated, Neolithic man in Europe
possessed domestic animals. He was not only a cultivator of the
soil, but he was a herdsman as well; and he kept herds of oxen,
sheep, and goats. Droves of hogs fattened on the nuts of the
forest, and the dog associated with man in keeping and protecting
these domestic animals. We know that the Swiss Lake inhabitants
built little stalls by the sides of their houses, in which they
kept their cattle at night. But these domestic animals were not
descendants of the wild animals that roamed the forests of
Europe. Like the plants, they are immigrants from the south-east.
Our best authorities consider they were brought into Europe by
the invading Neolithic tribes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The knowledge of husbandry, though rude, and
the possession of domestic animals, though of a few species only,
strikingly indicate the advance over the Paleolithic tribes. They
also had fixed places of living. This culture spread all over
Europe. That it was substantially the same everywhere there is no
doubt. Certain refuse heaps in Denmark, Scotland, and indeed in
all the sea-coast countries, have been thought to support a
different conclusion. Those of Denmark have been very carefully
studied, and so we will refer to them. All along the Baltic
coast, but especially in Denmark, have been discovered great
numbers of mounds, which were found to consist "almost entirely
of shells, especially of the oyster, broken bones of animals,
remains of birds and fishes, and, lastly, some wrought flints."
The first supposition in regard to those shell-heaps was that
they were of marine formation, accumulated beneath the sea, and
elevated to the surface along with the gradual rise of the land.
But they are now known to be nothing more or less than the sites
of ancient settlements. The location of the rude cabins can still
be traced. The ancient hearths are still in place. "Tribes once
existed here who subsisted on the products of hunting and
fishing, and threw out around their cabins the remains of their
meals, consisting especially of the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
shell- fish." These heaps gradually accumulated around their rude
dwellings, and now constitute the refuse heaps in question.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The careful investigation of their contents
has failed to disclose any evidence of a knowledge of
agriculture, and the only domestic animal found is the dog. The
implements are altogether of stone and horn. No trace of metal
has yet been obtained. As a rule, they are rudely made and
finished. Though of the Neolithic type, they are not polished
except in a few instances. The principal interest turns on the
question of age of these refuse heaps. Some think they were
accumulated at the very beginning of the Neolithic Age&mdash;that
these tribes preceded by many years the men of the Swiss Lakes.
Others think they were tribes of the same great people, living at
the same time. On such a point as this, only those who have
carefully studied the deposits are entitled to speak.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Some few facts stand out quite prominently.
The size of the mounds<a href="#Refer"><sup>25</sup></a> indicate
long-continued residence&mdash;showing that these people had
permanent places of abode. As they are not confined to Denmark,
but are found generally throughout Europe, it would seem to imply
that the Neolithic people preferred to live as fishers and
hunters wherever the surroundings were such that they could by
these means obtain an abundant supply of food. Some shell-heaps
in Scotland were still forming at the commencement of the Bronze
Age; and Mr. Geikie, on geological grounds, assigns the
shell-heaps of Denmark to a late epoch of the Stone Age.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It seems to us quite natural that isolated
tribes, living where game was abundant, and where fishing met
with a rich reward, should turn in disgust from the agricultural
life of their brother tribes, and, resuming the life of mere
hunters and fishers, speedily lose somewhat of their hardly won
culture&mdash;for civilization is the product of labor. Whenever
a people from necessity or choice abandon one form of labor for
another demanding less skill to triumph over nature, a
retrogression in culture is inevitable.<a href=

<img alt="Miner's Pick." src="images/Ch6_image/Miners_pick.jpg" height=
"206" width="162" align="LEFT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">From what we have stated as to the use of
flint we can readily see that it was a valuable material.
Sections where it was found in abundance would as certainly
become thickly populated as the iron and gold regions of our own
day. In Paleolithic times the supply of flint was mostly obtained
from the surface and in the gravel of rivers. In Neolithic times
men had learned to mine for flint. Flint occurs in nodules in the
chalk. Near Brandon, England, was discovered a series of these
workings. They consist of shafts connected together by galleries.
These pits vary in size from twenty to sixty feet in diameter,
and in some cases were as much as thirty feet deep. From the
bottom of these shafts they would excavate as far as they dared
to the sides. They made no use of timbers to support the roof,
and so these side excavations were not of great extent. In these
old workings the miners sometimes left behind them their tools.
The principal one was a pick made of deer's horn, as is here
represented. Besides these, they had chisels of bone and antler.
The marks of stone hatchets on the sides of the gallery are
visible.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In one instance the roof had caved in,
evidently during the night, and on clearing out the gallery near
the end where the roof stood firm, there were found the
implements of the workmen, just as they were left at the close of
the day's work; and in one place on the pick, covered with chalk
dust, was still to be seen the marks of the workman's hand. How
many years, crowded with strange scenes, have swept over England
since that chalky impression was made! The surface of the earth
is a palimpsest, on which each stage of culture has been written
over the faint, almost obliterated, records of the past. Not only
the living man, who has left there the impression of his hand has
passed away, but also his people and his culture. And now it is
only here and there that we catch a faint tracing underlying our
later civilization, by which we reconstruct the history of these
far-away times.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Nothing would be more natural than that where
flint was found in abundance a regular manufactory of implements
would be established. Such was the case at Cissbury, which we
have already mentioned as one of the early British towns. Mines
had been dug within the walls inclosing the town. The surface of
the ground near the old mines at this place is literally covered
by splinters of flint in every stage of manufacture, "from the
nodule of flint fresh out of the chalk, spoilt by an unlucky
blow, to the article nearly finished and accidentally broken."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>27</sup></a> Here the flint was mined and
chipped into rudimentary shape, but carried away to be perfected
and polished.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A very important place in Neolithic
manufactures was noticed near Tours, France. Here was an abundant
supply of flint, and very easily obtained, and the evidence is
conclusive that here existed real manufactories. Of one stretch
of ground, having an area of twelve or fourteen acres, we are
told: "It is impossible to walk a single step without treading on
some of these objects." Here we find "hatchets in all stages of
manufacture, from the roughest attempt up to a perfectly polished
weapon. We find, also, long flakes or flint-knives cleft off with
a single blow with astonishing skill."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">But in all these objects there is a defect; so
it is concluded that these specimens were refuse thrown aside in
the process of manufacture. As at Cissbury, very few polished
flints are found, so we may conclude the majority of weapons were
carried elsewhere for completion. But some weapons were completed
here. In the neighborhood have been found the stones used as
polishers. This cut shows us one used in polishing the axes. The
workmen would take one of the rough-hewn instruments, and,
rubbing it back and forth on such a stone as this, gradually
produced a smooth surface and a sharpened edge.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<center><img alt="Polishing Stone." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Polishing_stone.jpg" height="252" width=
"340"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have suggested that our civilization owes a
great deal to flint. If we will consider the surroundings of
their manufacturing sites, we will see the force of this remark.
It must have taxed to the utmost the powers of these primitive
men to sink the shafts and run the galleries to secure a supply
of this valuable stone. In short, they had to invent the art of
quarrying and working mines. This would lead to the division of
labor, for while one body of men would become experts as miners,
others would become skillful in chipping out the implements, and
still others would do the finishing and polishing. A system of
barter or trade would also arise, for the workmen at the mines
and factories would have to depend on others for food and
clothing, and in payment for the same would furnish them
implements. As localities where flint could be obtained in
suitable quantities are but few, we can see how trade between
widely scattered tribes would arise. This kind of traffic is
shown to have extended over wide distances in Neolithic times.
For instance, there was been found scattered over Europe axes
made of varieties of stone known as nephrite and jade. They were
highly valued by primitive tribes, being very hard and of a
beautiful green color. They are thought to have been employed in
the observance of superstitious rites. But quarries of these
varieties of stone do not occur in Europe. An immense amount of
labor has been expended in finding their native home. This is now
known to be in Asia.<a href="#Refer"><sup>29</sup></a>
Manufactured in Asia, axes of these materials may have drifted
into Europe and finally arrived in England.</p>

<center><img alt="Neolithic Boat-making." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Boatmaking.jpg" height="410" width="410"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Trade between different tribes must have been
greatly facilitated by means of canoes, which Neolithic man knew
well how to make. The art of navigation was probably well
advanced. The canoes were formed of the trunks of large trees. In
most cases they were hollowed out by means of the ax and fire
combined. Sometimes the ends were partially rounded or pointed,
but often cut nearly square across&mdash;rather a difficult shape
to propel fast or to guide properly. These ancient boats have
been found in nearly all the principal rivers of Europe, and in
many cases, no doubt, come down to much later date than the
Neolithic Age. From the remains of fish found in their refuse
heaps we are confident that in some such a shaped boat as this
they trusted themselves far out at sea. They served to transport
them from the shores of Europe to England, and at a later date to
Ireland.</p>

<img alt="Neolithic Cloth." src="images/Ch6_image/Cloth.jpg" height=
"147" width="150" align="RIGHT"> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">The clothing of the men of the Neolithic Age
doubtless consisted largely of the prepared skins of the animals,
and some fragments of leather have been found in the lake
settlements. But a very important step in advance was the
invention of spinning and weaving, both of which processes were
known at this time. The cloth which is here represented is
formed of twists of interwoven flax, of rough workmanship, it is
true, but none the less remarkable, considering the epoch in
which it was manufactured. Balls of thread and twine have also
been found.<a href="#Refer"><sup>30</sup></a> This cut is a
spindle-whorl. These have been discovered very often. They were
made sometimes of stone and at other times of pottery and bone.
The threads were made of flax, and the combs which were used for
pushing the threads of the warp into the weft show that it was
woven into linen on some kind of a loom. Several figures of the
loom have been given, but we have no certainty of their
correctness.<a href="#Refer"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us now see if we can gather anything as to
the religious belief of Neolithic man. On this point we can at
best only indulge in vague conjectures. Yet some light seems
thrown on this difficult subject by examination of the burial
mounds. This introduces us to a subject of much interest which,
in our hurried review, we can but glance at.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Scattered over Europe are found numbers of
mysterious monuments of the past. Some of them we have mentioned
already as the embankments surrounding ancient villages. But
aside from these are other monuments, such as burial mounds, rude
dolmens, and great standing stones, sometimes arranged in
circles, sometimes in rows, and sometimes standing singly. Many
of these remains may be of a far later date than the Neolithic
Age, still it is extremely difficult to draw a dividing line
between the monuments of different ages.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img alt="Dolmen, England." src="images/Ch6_image/Dolmen.jpg"
height="207" width="302"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Burial mounds are found everywhere, many in
Europe going back to the Neolithic Age, though some are of a very
recent construction. The Egyptian Pyramids are burial mounds on
the grandest scale. The first cut represents a Danish Tumulus, or
burial mound, of this Age. The openings lead to the center of the
mound, where they connect with chambers in which the bodies were
formerly placed. There are, of course, various modifications of
this tumulus. Often the gallery was omitted, a rude chamber was
erected, and a mound reared over it. Sometimes, indeed, no
chamber was made, but simply a mound placed over the body.</p>

<center><img alt="Dolmen, France." src=

<br>
<center><img alt="Dolmen, once covered with Earth." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Covered_Dolmen.jpg" height="143" width="380"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There have been found in England a great many
stones arranged as in the preceding cut, though generally not
built with such regularity as is there represented. They are
named Dolmens, a word meaning stone tables. They were more
generally made of rough stones, rudely arranged. This cut
represents one found in France. In early times these were
supposed to have been rude altars used by the mysterious Druids
in celebrating their rites. They are now known to be the tombs of
the Neolithic Age. They are, in fact, the chambers above
mentioned. The mound of earth has since disappeared and left its
chamber standing exposed to the air. Traces of the old passage
way are still met. Whether all Dolmens were once covered with
earth or not, is not yet known. In the majority of cases they
probably were. In the last cut portions of stone are still buried
in the earth. We are told that in India the people in some places
still erect Dolmens similar to those of Neolithic times.<a href=

<br>
<center><img alt="Stone Circle, England." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Stone_circle.jpg" height="148" width="380"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Aside from the tombs themselves, there are
other arrangements of great stones which must have once possessed
great significance to their builders, but their meaning is now
lost. Of this nature are the blocks of rough stone set up in the
ground generally in the vicinity of tombs. These are the standing
stones, or menhirs, which, as we have stated, are arranged in
various forms. When arranged in circles, they are generally
regarded as tombs. When placed in long parallel rows, as at
Carnac, in France, we are not sure of their meaning. We are told
that the Hill tribes of India to this day erect combinations of
gigantic stones into all the shapes we have here described.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The peculiar shape of the burial mounds, with
a passage way conducting us to an interior chamber, or series of
chambers, probably arose from the belief entertained by many
savage people, that the dead continue to live an existence much
like that when alive, and consequently the same surroundings were
deemed necessary for their comfort. So the tomb was made similar
to the house of the living. The ordinary Winter huts of the
Laplander are very similar in shape and size to the burial
tumuli, and amongst some people, as the inhabitants of New
Zealand, the house itself is made the grave. It was closed up and
painted red, and afterward considered sacred.</p>

<center><img alt="Chambered Tomb, France." src=
"images/Ch6_image/Chambered_tomb.jpg" height="167" width="344"></center>

<p align="JUSTIFY">So it may quite well be that the Neolithic
inhabitants of Denmark, "unable to imagine a future altogether
different from the present, or a world quite unlike our own,
showed their respect and affection for the dead by burying with
them those things which in life they had valued most; with women,
their ornaments, with warriors, their weapons. They buried the
house with its owner, and the grave was literally the dwelling of
the dead. When a great man died he was placed on his favorite
seat, food and drink was arranged before him, his weapons were
placed by his side, his house was closed, and the door covered
up, sometimes, however, to be opened again when his wife or
children joined him in the land of spirits."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">That they believed in a life beyond the grave
is shown by the objects they buried with the individuals. These
are implements of various kinds, flakes, arrow-heads, scrapers,
celts, and pottery, doubtless intended to be of service to the
deceased. We know this to be a very common proceeding amongst all
barbarous people. In some cases it would appear as if they
realized that the material things themselves could be of no
service to the departed, but imagined that in some vague way the
spirits of things might be of service to the spirits of men, and
so they would purposely break the flints and throw the fragments
into the grave. Sometimes they may have buried only models of the
objects they wished to give to the dead, imagining that in this
way the spirits of the objects represented would accompany and be
of service to the spirits of the departed. To this day the
Eskimos bury small models of boats, spears, etc., rather than the
objects themselves. The ancient Etruscans buried jewelry, but
made it so thin and fragile that it could not have been of
service to the living. In China this is carried still further,
and paper cuttings or drawings of horses, money, etc., are burned
at the grave.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These remarks may explain the absence of
remains so often noticed in Neolithic burials in England. But
other evidence can be given to show this belief in future life.
The mounds were of course often erected over noted chiefs, and we
are not without evidence that he was not allowed to go unattended
into the other world. It has been noted that often skeletons have
been met with having the skull, cleft, and in one case, at least,
all but one presented that appearance. It is but reasonable to
suppose that these skeletons were those of captives or slaves
sacrificed to be the attendants of the chief in the spirit world.
Funeral feasts were also held in honor of the dead. Thus we may
gather from burial mounds something of the religious belief of
their occupants.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is not improbable that ancestor worship, or
the worship of the dead, was part of their faith, so that the
mounds became temples. On this point we are told "it is
impossible not to believe then that the people who made these
great, and in some cases elaborately constructed, tombs would
continue ever after to regard them as in some sort consecrated to
the great chiefs who were buried under them. Each tribe would
have its own specially sacred tombs, and perhaps we may here see
a germ of that ancestor-worship which may be traced in every
variety of religions belief."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We now approach a difficult part of our
inquiry, but, at the same time, one that possesses for us a great
interest. Who were these people into whose culture we have been
inquiring? While laying the foundation of our present
civilization, though being the fountain head from whence many of
the arts and industries, which now make our existence comfortable
and happy, take their feeble origin, gradually developing and
expanding as the time rolls on, have they themselves, as a race,
vanished in the mighty past, or are their descendants still to be
found in Europe? Who were they? Whence and when? Difficult
problems, but we have read to but little purpose if we have not
already learned that earnest observers need but the slightest
clue to enable them to trace out brilliant results.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the first place, are there any grounds for
supposing the Neolithic people to be the descendants of those who
hunted the reindeer along the V&eacute;z&egrave;re? This view has
its supporters. M. Quatrefages, a very able scholar indeed,
maintains that the Neolithic people were the same race as those
who inhabited the caves and found shelter in the rock grottoes of
France.<a href="#Refer"><sup>35</sup></a> This, to others, does
not seem credible. We must recall the long lapse of time that it
is apparent has elapsed between the two ages. We have seen how
different were the two cultures; as Mr. Geikie remarks, "So
great, indeed, is the difference between the conditions of life
that obtained in the two ages of Stone, that we can hardly doubt
that the two people came of different stocks."<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>36</sup></a> The Neolithic people brought with them
domestic animals and plants whose native home is in Western Asia.
We can hardly account for this fact, if we suppose them to be the
descendants of Paleolithic tribes in France.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Abandoning, therefore, any attempt to trace
lines of connection between the people of the two ages, let us
carefully study all the facts connected with the Neolithic people
and their culture, to see if we can solve the problem by so
doing. We have noticed that substantially the same stage of
culture existed throughout Europe from Switzerland to the British
Islands. This points to the presence of a common race during at
least a portion of the time. But if there was a common race
living in Europe they would certainly possess common physical
features. As a race they may have been tall in stature, or
medium, or short, and portions of the human skeleton would show a
uniformity in this regard.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now one of the means that scientists use to
determine the races of men is a comparison of skulls, measured in
a systematic manner. The objection has been made that no reliance
can be placed on these results, because at the present day skulls
of all sorts of shapes and sizes can be obtained among people of
the same nationality. But these objections would not apply to
people of prehistoric times. Their surroundings would be simple
and natural&mdash;not artificial and complex, as in modern times.
In our times people of different nationality are constantly
coming in contact, and intermarriage results; but in prehistoric
times this was not liable to occur, and so the comparative purity
of blood would certainly produce a much greater uniformity of
physical features.<a href="#Refer"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From a very careful examination of a great
number of burial mounds in Great Britain, it has been ascertained
that in all of those that date back to Neolithic times, and
contain portions of human skeletons, the bones are always those
of individuals small in stature, the average height being about
five and a half feet. The skulls are of that variety known as
long skulls. From this we can at once form a mental picture of
the Neolithic inhabitants of Britain. No less important
conclusions have been deduced from the study of burial mounds on
the continent. We meet with remains of these same small-sized
people. "They have left traces of their presence in numerous
interments in chambered tombs and caves in Belgium and France, as
well as in Spain and Gibraltar. We may therefore conclude that at
one period in the Neolithic Age the population of Europe, west of
the Rhine and north of the Alps, was uniform in physique and
consisted of the same small people as the Neolithic inhabitants
of Britain and Ireland."<a href="#Refer"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We must now inquire whether there are any
people living in Europe which might have descended from the
original stock. We are in the position of those who, from a few
broken down arches, a ruined tower and dismantled wall, would
seek to form a mental picture of the stately building that once
stood there. If we can here and there discover, by the light of
history or exploration, some races or tribes that, owing to their
geographical position, have escaped the fate that befell the
great body of their countrymen, we may perhaps replace our mental
picture by one founded on reality. Nor need we be in doubt where
to seek for such scattered remnants of people. Successful
invaders always appropriate to their own use the fertile lowlands
and the fruitful portions of the country of their helpless foes.
But a weak people have often, in the rocky fastnesses of their
land, made a successful stand. So, to determine the race, we will
examine the people living in such regions, and see if there are
any that physically conform to what is already known of the
Neolithic people, and so entitled to claim a relationship by
descent.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Both slopes of Pyrenees Mountains, between
France and Spain, have been occupied from time immemorial by a
peculiar race of people known as the Basque. Secure in their
mountain homes, they have resisted foreign civilization, and
retained their national characteristics as well as their
liberties, though they have been nominally vassals to many
powers, from the early Carthaginians to the later French and
Spanish. From the many invasions they have undergone the Basque
language and people are by no meals uniform. But Dr. Broca, one
of the most learned anthropologists in Europe, has shown that the
original Basques were dark in complexion, with black hair and
eyes. In addition to this, the efforts of some of the most
eminent scholars in Europe,<a href="#Refer"><sup>39</sup></a> who
have made numerous examinations of skulls and skeletons obtained
from ancient Basque cemeteries, have conclusively shown that in
all physical features the Basques agree with men of Neolithic
times.<a href="#Refer"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Basques do not belong to the great
division of the human family known as Aryans, to which the
English-speaking races, as well as the nations of Europe
generally, belong. They belong to a far older division of the
human family&mdash;the Turanian<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>41</sup></a>&mdash;and were doubtless in possession
of Europe long before the Indo- European nations commenced their
westward migrations from Central Asia. They are described as
being brave, industrious, and frugal, with patriarchal manners
and habits. They scorn authority, except what emanates from
themselves, and have but few nobility. They are impetuous, merry,
and hospitable, fond of music and dancing.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>42</sup></a> Of their warfare we are told they are
"not distinguished in open warfare, but unconquerable in
guerrilla warfare, and famed for defense of walled cities."<a
href="#Refer"><sup>43</sup></a> Such are the Basques of to-day,
and many of these traits of character, we doubt not, were the
same amongst the Neolithic people.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Dawkins also thinks that two tribes,
living in Northern Italy, in the very earliest historical times,
are other remnants of the same people. One of these were the
Ligurians. Investigations and traditions show that some time
before the dawn of history they had been driven out of the
pleasant parts of Southern France, but had made a successful
stand in the mountain regions of Northern Italy. They, like the
Basques, were strong, active, and warlike. They were small in
stature, swarthy in features, and long-headed. To the south of
these were the Etruscans. But little is known of them, though the
evidence is that long before the Christian Era they were a
powerful people. In physical features they resembled those
already described. Their sculpture exhibits only short, sturdy
figures, with large heads and thick arms. Another possible
remnant of these people existed at the very dawn of history in
the mountainous regions of Wales. They were known as Silures. but
have since become absorbed in the surrounding population. In
civilization and physical features they agree with the remnants
already described.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the north of Russia are found the Finns.
Their origin and migrations are alike unknown. One thing is
certain, they belong to the Turanian family, and so are probably
allied to the Basques and Etruscans. It is possible that they
also are but a sorry remnant of the once wide-spread Neolithic
people. Driven out of the fairer portions of Europe, they hive
found an asylum in their present bleak surroundings. Like the
people already described, they are short in stature, and dark
visaged.<a href="#Refer"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The tribes we have thus briefly mentioned are
regarded by some as representatives of the Neolithic people.
Prof. Winchell, speaking of the wide-spread extension of the
Turanian race, assures us, that "history, tradition, linguistics,
and ethnology conspire to fortify the conclusions that, in
prehistoric times, all Europe was overspread by the Mongoloid
(Turanian) race, of which remnants have survived to our own times
in the persons of the Basques, Finns, Esths, Lapps, and some
smaller tribes."<a href="#Refer"><sup>45</sup></a> Researches
into the surroundings of these people, combined with what we have
already learned as to the culture, customs, and manners of the
Neolithic people in the preceding pages, throw no little light on
this age. The darkness of oblivion seems dispelled by the light
of science, and we behold before us the Europe of Neolithic
times, thickly inhabited by a race of people, small in stature,
dark visaged, and oval-faced&mdash;fond of war and the chase, yet
having a rude system of agriculture. The picture seems complete;
and we have now only to raise some inquiries as to the great
stock of people to which they belonged, and conjecture as to the
date of their arrival in Europe.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We are now learning that far back in the past,
when mankind was yet young in the world, the great Turanian
family held a commanding position. They seem to have dispersed
widely over the earth. Their migrations began long before that of
the Aryan and Semitic people. When tribes of these later people
began their wanderings, they found a Turanian people inhabiting
the country wherever they went. Long before the times of Abraham,
the fertile plains of Chaldea were the home of powerful tribes of
this family. Egypt, and the fertile Nile Valley, the home of
ancient civilization, was their possession at a time long
preceding the rise of the Pharaohs. Their Asiatic origin is
corroborated by what we have learned of their domestic animals
and cereals, which we know to be also from Asia, or the south-
east. These Turanian tribes, at some far remote time, must have
appeared in Asia Minor. Urged onward by the pressure of
increasing population, they passed into Europe and Northern
Africa. Their progress was, doubtless, slow; but they gradually
filled Europe. The English Channel must have presented no
inconsiderable barrier, and it was after Europe had been
populated for a long time that they ventured to brave its passage
in their rude canoes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Neolithic culture, which we have treated
of in reference to Europe only, is seen to have been of Turanian
origin. From its Asiatic home it spread over the entire
world&mdash;to the islands of the Pacific, and even America. The
road that leads from barbarism to civilization is long and
difficult, and it is not strange that but one or two families of
men were able to attain that end by their own unaided effort.<a
href="#Refer"><sup>47</sup></a> The Turanian Family, which
probably advanced man from savagism into barbarism, seems to have
at that stage exhausted its energies. This is but an illustration
of the fact that a race, like an individual, has a period of
growth, a maturity of healthful powers, and an old age of slow
decadence. After thus dispersing over the world, carrying with
them the culture of the Neolithic Age, they seem to have halted
in their progress. It remained for a new people, starting,
perhaps, from the same state of culture, but with new energies,
to discover and employ metals in the construction of tools and
implements. This gave them so great a command over nature that
civilization became possible. But whatever considerable advance
the Turanian races were able to make beyond the Neolithic culture
was by reason of intercourse with these later people. Where
completely isolated from them, as in the New World, they
remained, for the most part, in the Neolithic culture.<a href=
"#Refer"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We have hitherto spoken as if there was but
one race in Europe during Neolithic times. In the main this is
true; yet, near the close of this time, a different race arrived
in Europe. That this is so, is proved by the same line of
evidence used to determine the Neolithic people. We shall have
much to say of them hereafter. They were the vanguard of the
great Aryan race. This calls for some explanation. It has been
found that the principal languages of Europe and South-western
Asia have certain common characteristics; so much so that we are
justified, even compelled, to assume that the nations speaking
these languages, such for instance as the Teutonic, Sclavic,
Italic, Greek, Persian, Hindoostanee, and others, are descendants
from a common ancestor. These people are called, collectively,
Aryans. They were the ones who drove the Turanians out of the
fairest portions of Europe. Though they appeared at a late date,
they have filled the most important places in history, and the
civilization of the world to-day is Aryan.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now we must again form a mental picture of
Neolithic Europe&mdash; after it had been for a long time in the
possession of the Turanian tribes, the first band of Aryan
invaders make their appearance. They must have appeared somewhere
near the south- eastern confines of Europe, but they pressed
forward to the western portion. They firmly seated themselves in
the western and central parts of Europe, driving out the Turanian
tribes who had so long possessed the land. They were themselves
still in the Neolithic stage of culture. But they probably did
not long antedate the knowledge of metals. Mr. Dawkins thinks
that it caught up with them before they arrived in Britain, and
that they are the ones who introduced bronze into that island.
The Aryan tribe, who thus made their appearance in Europe, are
identified as the Celts of history.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Neolithic Age thus drew to its close, but
not all at once. It disappeared first in the southern portion of
Europe&mdash;from Greece and Italy; but it lingered to a far
later date in the north: among the scattered tribes of Turanian
people it would still assert its sway. Even after metals were
introduced, the cheapness and abundance of stone would cause it
to be used, among the poorer people at least. But finally this
culture gives way to a higher one in Europe&mdash;though it still
survived in portions of Asia, the Isles of the Pacific, and in
America. We can but reflect on the difference between the two
ages of stone. The former ends amidst Arctic scenes&mdash;and, in
the darkness that ensues, ages pass before we again detect the
presence of man. The Neolithic closes gradually, everywhere
giving way to a higher culture. We must not forget that our
present civilization owes much to our far away Neolithic
ancestors. When we reflect on the difficulties that had to be
overcome before animals could be profitably held in a domestic
state, or cultivation of the earth made profitable, we almost
wonder that they succeeded in either direction. Aside from these,
we turn to them for the origin of trade, navigation, and mining.
No inconsiderable part of the battle of civilization had thus
been won.</p>
